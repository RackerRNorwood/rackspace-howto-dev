Everyone who has a Rackspace cloud account can use the Rackspace Cloud
Control Panel to create and manage devices and the Rackspace
Intelligence dashboard to observe infrastructure status.

As you create new servers and databases with your cloud account,
Rackspace Intelligence automatically recognizes them as entities. By
taking some extra steps, you can enable Rackspace Intelligence to give
you full information on the status of those entities.

If you explicitly define something other than a cloud server or cloud
database as an entity, Rackspace Intelligence can also monitor its
status.

Begin monitoring a cloud server
-------------------------------

To be able to view all relevant data, you should [install the Cloud
Monitoring
agent](/knowledge_center/article/install-and-configure-the-cloud-monitoring-agent)
on any cloud server that you want to monitor with Rackspace
Intelligence. [Setting up a server to work with Rackspace
Intelligence](/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-a-server-to-work-with-rackspace-intelligence)
shows the process of installing the agent on a cloud server and shows
how that server appears to Rackspace Intelligence before and after the
agent is installed.

Begin monitoring a cloud database
---------------------------------

[Setting up a database to work with Rackspace
Intelligence](/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-a-database-to-work-with-rackspace-intelligence)
shows how to define the characteristics of a database for Rackspace
Intelligence's monitoring.
