<h2>Quick Facts</h2><p>Here are some important facts to consider when creating a new instance:</p><ul><li>The length of the instance name is limited to 255 characters and any characters are permitted.</li><li>You can create a database instance with one or more databases. Databases and users can be configured when you create the instance or at a later time.</li><li>Each database can have an unlimited number of users associated with it.</li><li>The default binding for the MySQL instance is port 3306.</li></ul><h3>Accessibility</h3><p>For enhanced security, database instances are directly accessible on the internal Rackspace Network and by using a Cloud resource within the same regional data center. For example, a database instance in DFW can only be accessed by a Cloud Server in DFW. For more information, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/node/2411">Public Vs.
