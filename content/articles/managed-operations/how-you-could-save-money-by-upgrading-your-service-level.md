The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your
total cloud expense by splitting the cost of infrastructure and support.
The support cost, or "Service Level Rate", is determined by the total
compute power used. The infrastructure Rate is based on the amount of GB
of RAM used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of server.
This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers.
For instance, 20 1GB servers cost the same as 10 2GB servers.



### Will it save you money?

It could. This table illustrates, for example, a savings of \$87.60 per
month for Infrastructure Service Level customers upgrading to Managed
Infrastructure:

### **What is the Service Level Rate?**

The Service Level Rate covers maintenance and support of all your cloud
compute products (such as servers). It is based upon your service level.
The Managed Infrastructure rate is \$0.005 per gigabyte hour; the
Managed Operations rate is \$0.02 per gigabyte hour. OnMetal servers
have a flat hourly rate indpendent of RAM.

The minimum Service Level Rates for Managed Infrastructure and Managed
Operations are \$50 and \$500, respectively. If you do not meet the
minimum during your billing cycle, the difference is assessed to your
account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level
Rate is only assessed against compute products. Storage services such as
Cloud Files and Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates
associated with them. There are no minimums for Standard Next Generation
Servers at the Managed Infrastructure level.
