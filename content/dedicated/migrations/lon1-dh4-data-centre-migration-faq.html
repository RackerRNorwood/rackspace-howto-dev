<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>Rackspace is opening a new data centre, LON5, in May 2015. The new data centre will support our customersâ€™ growth with newer technologies and enable us to offer customers our current hosting product portfolio. To this end, we will be closing the LON1 data centre and all customers' solutions currently hosted in LON1 will be migrated to the new data centre; customers in the DH4 Data Centre will be moved to LON3. The migration period will start in May and end in October.</p>

<p>Rackspace has had widespread success in data centre migrations over the past 12 years. During this time our dedicated migration teams have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2009, migrated 15,000 devices from our LON2 Data Centre into our LON3 Data Centre</li>
	<li>In 2011, migrated 3,828 devices from our SAT1 and SAT2 Data Centres to our DFW1 Data Centre</li>
	<li>In 2012, migrated 8,200 devices from our IAD1 Data Centre to our DFW1 and IAD3 Data Centres</li>
</ul>

<p>During these migrations, the teams returned 100% of solutions online within the advertised move window and experienced a component failure rate of less than 1 percent.</p>

<p>We realise that you have chosen Rackspace as your hosting provider because you trust our expertise and commitment to support you. You can rest assured that we have invested significant planning and resources in thorough migration planning. This article answers many of the questions you may have about this planned migration. You have further questions, see the <a href="#Who should I contact if I have more questions about the migration?">contact information</a> at the bottom of this article.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Why is Rackspace closing the LON1 Data Centre?" name="Why is Rackspace closing the LON1 Data Centre?"></a></strong><strong>Why is Rackspace closing these data centres?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rackspace has operated the LON1 Data Centre for nearly 14 years, providing you and other customers with a stable and secure location. Although it has served Rackspace and our customers well, advances in data centre design and our own product portfolio enhancements over the years have rendered LON1 less efficient and flexible than our other data centre facilities. Significant upgrades to electrical and network infrastructure would be required to deploy many of our new products and services to solutions present in LON1. The risks involved in implementing these upgrades, outweigh the benefits of such significant works.</p>

<p>DH4 was originally brought online in March 2013 to ease capacity in LON3 caused by extensive growth. At that time, LON5 was in the initial design phases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><a id="What are the high level stages of the migration?" name="What are the high level stages of the migration?"></a></strong></h3>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>How will these migration be performed?</strong></h3>

<p>LON1 will close in June 2015 and DH4 in October 2015. The migrations will be handed as two separate projects. The stages are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your migration date will be determined by the location of your hosted devices. To minimise the impact to customers we will move servers in small contiguous blocks.</li>
	<li>Before your migration date, Rackspace will work with you and your account team to establish any specific requirements for the move.</li>
	<li>On the date of your migration, all affected devices will be physically powered down.</li>
	<li>The affected devices will be securely transported to the new data centre facility.</li>
	<li>All devices will be reconnected and powered up.</li>
	<li>Your configuration will be tested and verified at an infrastructure level. Your account team can arrange further testing, if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The geographical relocation will not be apparent to external users.</p>

<h3><a id="Will there be any interruption to service?" name="Will there be any interruption to service?"></a></h3>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Will service be interrupted?</strong></h3>

<p>To minimize the amount of downtime for customers, Rackspace has designed the migration to occur in small contiguous blocks.. Our project plan also seeks to reduce the amount of unplanned downtime by including additional resources and multiple contingency plans. The total scheduled migration window will be eight hours but our goal is to return to service as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a id="Will there be any IP or DNS changes I need to worry about?" name="Will there be any IP or DNS changes I need to worry about?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Will there be any IP or DNS changes?</strong></h3>

<p>For the LON1 to LON5 migration, the primary and secondary IP addresses of your devices will move with the devices to the new location. You will not need to make any changes to your DNS.</p>

<p>For DH4 to LON3 migrations, only the primary IP address of your firewall will need to change.</p>

<p><a id="When are my servers scheduled to be migrated?" name="When are my servers scheduled to be migrated?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>When are my servers scheduled to be migrated?</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>You will receive a notification via a ticket on the Rackspace customer portal at least three months in advance of your migration date. The ticket will include the specific date and time that your solution will be moved.</li>
	<li>You will receive an additional notification 60 days and 30 days before the migration date.</li>
	<li>One week before the migration date, you will receive a final reminder.</li>
	<li>On the night of the migration, you will receive a notification confirming the migration will proceed as scheduled.</li>
	<li>After your solution arrives in the new data centre, you will receive an update notification confirming a safe physical delivery of your solution.</li>
	<li>After your solution is back online you will receive a further update confirming the completion of the migration.</li>
</ol>

<p><a id="How will I need to prepare for the migration?" name="How will I need to prepare for the migration?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>How do I prepare for the migration?</strong></h3>

<p>Rackspace will use all of our experience of data centre migration projects to help support you during the migration to the new data centre. We have a dedicated migration team that will work with you and your account team to determine and arrange any special requirements that you might have for pre- and post-migration as we power down and power up your solution. The migration team will then be focused on successfully executing on all the specifications on the night of the migration.</p>

<p>We encourage customers to make their own offsite backups and to use the Managed Backup solution Rackspace offers. If your solution is not currently being backed up, we recommend that you talk to your Rackspace account team to get backups in place before the migration date.</p>

<p><a id="Is the move date flexible, can I choose the date of the migration?" name="Is the move date flexible, can I choose the date of the migration?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Is the move date flexible? Can I choose the date of the migration?</strong></h3>

<p>The migration project has been split into phases based on the physical data centre configuration. To avoid having to change IP addresses on your solution we have to move customers in a set time frame during each phase. Rackspace will give you advance notice of this date and time so that you can plan accordingly with your customers and end users but&nbsp; we cannot change the date of your move without further impacting your solution.</p>

<p>If your scheduled migration date is so impractical for you that a rescheduled date becomes absolutely necessary then an IP address change might be required on your solution. This change will include DNS changes and potential configuration work on your side to accommodate the new IP addresses.</p>

<h3><a id="I have more than one solution with Rackspace, will they all be migrated at the same time?" name="I have more than one solution with Rackspace, will they all be migrated at the same time?"></a></h3>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>I have more than one solution with Rackspace. Will they all be migrated at the same time?</strong></h3>

<p>Migration time depends on where those solutions are physically located within the data centre. The move has been split into phases; if the solutions are in the same phase, they will be moved in the same time frame.</p>

<p><a id="Will any of the services that Rackspace currently offer me change?" name="Will any of the services that Rackspace currently offer me change?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Will my services changes?</strong></h3>

<p>There will be no change to any of the services that you currently consume. The only change to your solution will be the physical location.</p>

<p>As part of the migration strategy, Rackspace is excited about the number of additional value-add services that we will be able to offer our customers from our full Managed Cloud portfolio.</p>

<p><a id="How will my solution be transported?" name="How will my solution be transported?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>How will my solution be transported?</strong></h3>

<p>We will be using a third party specialist transport company. To ensure the safe transportation of your solution Rackspace has carefully and extensively planned this migration and selected appropriate partners to mitigate any risks arising from the move. Vendor analysis and risk evaluation and mitigation documents are available upon request from the migration team if you want to review them.</p>

<p>The vehicles will be loaded within our data centres and are subject to our stringent physical security controls. They will be unloaded within the same conditions in LON5.&nbsp; The tailgate of the truck will be locked with a special bolt by two Rackspace personnel.&nbsp; The trucks will have GPS tracking. They will not carry the Rackspace logo. The trucks will be followed by Rackspace personnel.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Will my server have to be migrated again in the future?</strong></h3>

<p>Rackspace has invested heavily in the design and construction of the LON5 Data Centre and in our partnership with Digital Realty Trust, a company dedicated to data centre design and construction.</p>

<p>The lease associated with the LON5 Data Centre is in excess of 20 years. We hope that this provides you some reassurance that we are making every effort not to migrate you again in the future.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Am I entitled to any compensation resulting from this move?</strong></h3>

<p>To carry out the migration, we are scheduling a eight hour migration window as a scheduled maintenance. You might be entitled to a service credit under your contractual arrangements with Rackspace for downtime that is not associated with a permitted scheduled maintenance. You will be entitled to claim any service credit due to you in the normal manner.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Where is LON5 located?</strong></h3>

<p>This facility is located near Crawley, Sussex. For security reasons, we have not published the address in this FAQ. You can obtain the address from your account team on a confidential basis and with valid justification, such as the need to coordinate the installation of private circuits.</p>

<p><a id="Does the LON5 Data Centre have the same level of redundancy and security as the LON1 Data Centre?" name="Does the LON5 Data Centre have the same level of redundancy and security as the LON1 Data Centre?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Does the LON5 Data Centre have the same level of redundancy and security as the LON1 Data Centre?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, the LON5 Data Centre provides the same or improved levels of redundancy and more resilience in its electrical and mechanical infrastructure than LON1. Security protocols and operations for LON5 are in line with all data centres in the Rackspace global portfolio.</p>

<p><a id="What assurance can Rackspace provide customers regarding security controls in the new LON5 Data Centre?" name="What assurance can Rackspace provide customers regarding security controls in the new LON5 Data Centre?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>What assurance can Rackspace provide customers regarding security controls in the new LON5 Data Centre?</strong></h3>

<p>All Rackspace entities implement uniform global data centre security and environmental controls in their data centres.</p>

<p>The new LON5 Data Centre will implement the same standard security controls that have been implemented in our other data centres and that have been assessed in those other data centre as meeting the requirements of our ISO 27001, PCI-DSS SP L1 and ISAE / SSAE standards.</p>

<p>LON5 will undergo external assessment against ISOv27001 before opening to our customers, with the other compliance standards being audited externally in line with our set annual compliance schedule.</p>

<p>Customers will be able to request a copy of our ISO 27001 certificate, as well as an attestation from our Compliance Director that states that the appropriate security and environmental controls have been implemented to meet the PCI DSS SP L1 and ISAE/ SSAE standards to which we adhere.</p>

<p><a id="Has an SSAE16 / ISAE 3402 SOC report been completed for the LON5 Data Centre?" name="Has an SSAE16 / ISAE 3402 SOC report been completed for the LON5 Data Centre?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Has an SSAE16 / ISAE 3402 SOC report been completed for the LON5 Data Centre?</strong></h3>

<p>The LON5 Data Centre will come online in the middle of the Rackspace ISAE / SSAE annual audit cycle and will therefore not be assessed upon opening.</p>

<p>The reporting period for the Rackspace Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3 reports is from 1 October to 31 September. The assessment will be conducted by our auditors between September and November 2015, with the final report being made available in early December 2015.</p>

<p><a id="Will the LON5 Data Centre be PCI-DSS compliant?" name="Will the LON5 Data Centre be PCI-DSS compliant?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>Will the LON5 Data Centre be PCI-DSS compliant?</strong></h3>

<p>The LON5 Data Centre will come online before the Rackspace Annual PCI-DSS Service Provider audit.</p>

<p>The PCI-DSS SP L1 external audit will occur between May and July 2015. The Attestation of Compliance will then be available for customers by early August 2015.</p>

<p><a id="What are the green credentials of the new LON5 Data Centre?" name="What are the green credentials of the new LON5 Data Centre?"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">&lt;top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><strong>What are the green credentials of the new LON5 Data Centre?</strong></h3>

<p>In support of our commitment to our customers, our employees and the environment, our LON3 Data Centre and our UK head office (LON4) are certified to the international environmental management standard, ISO 14001, which provides a framework for managing our environmental responsibilities, including energy and waste management. We will extend the scope of this to LON5 in the next audit cycle. In the meantime following are some of the initiatives we have implemented in LON5 to reduce our carbon footprint:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The data centre construction will have a BREEAM rating of Very Good. BREEAM for new construction covers items such as environmentally sourced paint, LED lighting, minimising land fill and impact on environment during construction</li>
	<li>LON5 will have an annualised Power Usage Effectiveness (PuE) of 1.15 (versus 1.58 in LON3)</li>
	<li>Removal of the mechanical cooling systems in the data halls means we can maintain a more stable PuE rating for the facility</li>
	<li>The indirect cooling solution uses much lower water quantities than other systems in its class and significantly less water than a cooling tower</li>
	<li>Rain harvesting will be leveraged and used in back of house amenities and for the adiabatic spray in the indirect cooling solution.</li>
	<li>Sun pipes in some areas will bring in natural light to reduce the need for artificial lighting</li>
	<li>Power will be pulled into the site from higher up the grid to attain a more efficient delivery of power to the site</li>
</ul>
