<h3>What does it mean to have a Rackspace Managed Operations account?</h3>

<p>A Rackspace Managed Operations account extends the managed support level from our Managed Hosting offering into our Cloud offering. This offer provides an additional level of support and management that includes monitoring, OS and application infrastructure layer support, and technical guidance on your Rackspace Cloud portfolio.</p>

<h3>What is included with a Rackspace Managed Operations account?</h3>

<p>Managed Operations accounts include access to a dedicated support team available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week via phone, chat, email and online support ticket. The team will support your cloud servers from the operating system level up through the application stack of Microsoft SQL Server, .NET and IIS, and the LAMP stack on Linux. Your cloud server will be regularly patched and updated. Additionally, Rackspace will manage your <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/databases/">Cloud Databases</a>, providing basic DBA assistance such as user and table management and data backup. Monitoring services are included, with the Managed Operations team proactively responding to any alerts. As a Managed Operations customer you can configure up to eight monitors per server with any combination of ping, port, or URL.</p>

<h3>What operating systems and applications are supported for Cloud Servers with Managed Operations?</h3>

<p>You can view the list of supported operating system versions and applications for Linux and Windows Managed Operations servers in the following article: <a href="/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-service-level-spheres-of-support">Cloud Servers With Managed Operations - Spheres of Support</a></p>

<h3>Will my server's IP address or hostname change when I upgrade?</h3>

<p>No. &nbsp;Upgrading to a Managed Operations account does not change server IP address or hostname. &nbsp;Further, there are no changes to the server instance IDs, nor is there a change to your account number and username/password combination. &nbsp;All of these remain the same with the upgrade process.</p>

<h3>What if my current Cloud Server operating system is not on the list?</h3>

<p>At this time, the only operating systems we support for a Rackspace Managed Operations account are listed in the <a href="/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-service-level-spheres-of-support">article referenced above</a>. If you choose to upgrade to a Managed Operations account, you must either delete any active Cloud Servers and images with unsupported operating systems or transfer those unsupported images to a separate account. Once the servers and images have been transferred you will be eligible to upgrade. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When needing a new Cloud Server or Cloud Database, you may choose to create the image on the server yourself, or one of the Managed Operations team members can create it for you. Either way, we will keep it updated, patched, and running for you.</p>

<h3>Who is eligible to upgrade?</h3>

<p>To upgrade to a Rackspace Managed Operations account, your account must meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The account must be in active status and up to date on all billing invoices.</li>
	<li>No Cloud Servers on the account run on unsupported operating systems.</li>
	<li>No Cloud Server images on the account are built on unsupported operating systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud Sites customers can upgrade their&nbsp;<strong>servers only</strong>&nbsp;to Managed Operations.</p>

<p>A technical account manager can assist you to ensure that Managed Operations is the best fit for your needs.</p>

<h3>What does a Rackspace Managed Operations account cost?</h3>

<p>Upon the creation of a Cloud Server or a Cloud Database within a Managed Operations account, a flat monthly account fee will be assessed when at least one instance on the account is active or used during that month. For more pricing information, please see:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Why is there an account fee as well as a per-instance service fee?</h3>

<p>Both the account fee (assessed per account) and the per-instance service fee (assessed per Cloud Server or Database instance) allow Rackspace to provide you with our managed service at the lowest possible cost. &nbsp;The account fee covers the administration of your account on a monthly basis. &nbsp;The service fee covers the administration of each server instance.</p>

<h3>Will the account fee be assessed with only partial-month usage of a managed Cloud Server, or will it be prorated?</h3>

<p>The account fee will not be prorated. The service fee, however, is a utility fee and you will only be charged for the amount of time your instance is active.</p>

<h3>Will the Rackspace support team automatically scale Cloud Servers if necessary?</h3>

<p>Not at this time. However, if you notice issues or have questions about capacity, your Rackspace account team will work with you and recommend solutions.</p>

<h3>Will Rackspace troubleshoot programming code for customers?</h3>

<p>Noâ€”your Rackspace account team will not troubleshoot your program code.</p>

<h3>What backups are performed?</h3>

<p>New Cloud Servers with the Managed Operations include a basic Rackspace Cloud Backup configuration that backs up directories that commonly contain user data weekly. The default backup profile is not a full system backup. Our support team can assist you with adding more locations to the backup profile or changing the time interval between backups.</p>

<p>Cloud Backup stores its archives in Cloud Files, so standard storage and bandwidth costs for Cloud Files do apply. Deleting a cloud server will not delete associated backup archives in Cloud Files - they must be manually removed.</p>

<h3>Why do I need a separate account for my Cloud Servers and Databases with Managed Operations?</h3>

<p>Since the managed operations is offered at the account level, every cloud product in the account receives the managed operations. Therefore, if you want Cloud Servers or Cloud Databases that do not have managed operations and some that do, you will need to have a separate account for the Cloud products without a Managed Operations.</p>

<h3>What does the upgrade process entail?</h3>

<p>During the upgrade process, Rackspace will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reset the root password for each server to gain access to the server.</li>
	<li>Make an image of each server.</li>
	<li>Create a Rackspace management account on each server.</li>
	<li>Open TCP port 445 on Windows to allow Rackspace management server access.</li>
	<li>Install the Rackspace Cloud Backup agent.</li>
	<li>Install the vendor-provided kernel and prepare for updates (if needed).</li>
</ul>

<h3>As a Rackspace customer, can I link my Managed Hosting configuration and account to a Cloud Server with Managed Operations configuration and account?</h3>

<p>Yes, the same way you are currently able to link your Managed Hosting accounts and your cloud accounts.</p>

<h3>How do I contact my Rackspace Managed Operations account team?</h3>

<p>You can contact the Rackspace Managed Operations account team via chat, phone or by submitting a ticket online. The phone number and links to all of these options are accessible in the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<h3>What if I want to downgrade from my Rackspace Managed Operations account?</h3>

<p>We only allow upgrades to a Rackspace Managed Operations account at this time. &nbsp;If you wish to remove the managed service, a new account will need to be created and new Cloud Servers and Cloud Databases built.</p>
