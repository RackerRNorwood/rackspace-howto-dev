<p>This article demonstrates how to use the Self-Service Migration Tool provided in the Cloud Office Control Panel to copy email data from your previous provider to Rackspace Email or Microsoft Exchange. The Self-Service MIgration Tool uses our private-label version of MigrationWiz, which you can run at any time at no additional cost.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some of the features that are present in the full version of MigrationWiz (at migrationwiz.com) are not readily available within the Self-Service Migration Tool. If you want to use the full version, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/accessing-the-full-version-of-migrationwiz">Accessing the Full Version of MigrationWiz</a>.</p>

<h2>Premigration steps</h2>

<p>Before you begin your migration, you need to create your mailboxes on the Rackspace environment.&nbsp;The migration tool does not create your mailboxes for you.</p>

<p>Use the following resources to help you create your mailboxes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rackspace Email:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-rackspace-email-mailboxes">How to add Rackspace Email mailboxes</a></li>
	<li>Microsoft Exchange:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-microsoft-exchange-mailboxes-0">How to add Microsoft Exchange mailboxes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need the usernames and passwords for both your previous service and the Rackspace environment.&nbsp;The migration tool requires that you enter this information.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To ensure that mail is routed properly to your new mailboxes, you must update the MX records&nbsp;for your domain.&nbsp; The following article provides you with the appropriate DNS records:</p>

	<p>You are redirected to the MigrationWiz portal.</p>

	<p><img alt="" border="2" height="318" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/4-2_0.png" width="250" /></p>

	<p>A notification informs you that an email with a secure link has been sent to your email address. Follow the instructions in the email to log in to the MigrationWiz portal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Locate your existing email service server information and determine what kind of service you have (POP, IMAP, or Exchange).
	<ul>
		<li>IMAP: If you use Outlook, the incoming server address can be found under your account settings. It typically looks like <strong>mail.domain.com</strong> or <strong>imap.domain.com</strong>.</li>
		<li>Webmail: Your server address is a portion of the webmail URL. For example, if your webmail address is <strong>https://webmail.domain.com</strong>, then your server address is <strong>webmail.domain.com</strong>.</li>
		<li>Exchange: Your Outlook Web Access (OWA) address is the best way to connect. Check your mail via an Internet browser. It typically looks like <strong>https://mail.domain.com/owa</strong> or <strong>https://mail.domain.com/exchange</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Enter your source and destination server configuration settings.&nbsp;
	<ol type="A">
		<li>Select the source server system type and enter the server address. For IMAP, you must also enter a port number. IMAP ports are 993 (secure) and 143 (non-secure).</li>
		<li>For the destination server, select the service that you are migrating to, Rackspace Email or Microsoft Exchange 2013, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	</ol>

	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to begin the trial migration.
