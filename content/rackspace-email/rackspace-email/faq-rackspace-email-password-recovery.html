<p>You can recover the password for your Rackspace Email account by having our system send your phone a text message verifying your identity. This feature must be enabled by your site administrator, and you'll need to enter a mobile phone number for your account before it will work.</p>

<p>Rackspace will only use your phone number for security verification purposes. We will never sell or share it.</p>

<p>Below are some frequently asked questions and answers about this feature.</p>

<h2>Why is Webmail asking for my mobile phone number?</h2>

<p>Webmail prompts you periodically to provide an up-to-date mobile phone number. Providing an up-to-date mobile phone number gives you access to a self-service password recovery feature, in case you ever forget your password.</p>

<h2>How will my mobile phone number be used?</h2>

<p>Your number is used only for account security purposes such as password recovery.</p>

<h2>Will you share my phone number with third parties?</h2>

<p>The mobile phone number that you provide in Webmail will never be sold to advertisers or other third parties. We might disclose your phone number if it is reasonably necessary to comply with the law.</p>
