**Note**: This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control

Now that you are familiar with how to manage all of your account details
under the [Your
Account](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/node/2005) tab, the
next section shows you how to get Fanatical Support through our many
support channels.

-   When you log into the control panel, in the **Getting Help**
    section, you will see a link to **Live Chat**.  In addtion, our
    support telephone number is provided along with links to helpful
    documentaion and the community forum.

-   You will also notice that the **Cloud Status**, **Knowledge Base**,
    **Rackspace Community**, **Tickets**, and **Live Chat** links are
    available across the top menu of all pages, as well as the Support
    phone numbers for the United States and United Kingdom.  If you are
    ever experiencing a critical problem and need immediate support,
    please call as at one of these numbers:
    -   **United States 24-hour Support:  800-961-4454**
    -   **United Kingdom 24-hour Support:  0800-083-3012**
    -   **International: 1-210-312-4000**

-   **Cloud Status** - Having a problem getting to the Control Panel, or
    any other Rackspace Cloud services?  The first place you should
    check is the Cloud Status page.  This is where we list all
    maintenances and service impacting events.  There is a different
    Status page for **Cloud Sites**, **Cloud Servers**, and **Email**.
     This is because a maintenance or outage may only be impacting one
    product, while others remain unaffected. 

 

-   **Knowledge Base / Knowledge Center** - This valuable resource
    contains numerous articles, tutorials, videos, white papers, and
    webinars to help you find all available information on using the
    Rackspace Cloud.  How do we know it's valuable?  Because ***you are
    using it right now!***  You can get to the Knowledge Center directly
    by going to:
     [http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge\_center](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center) 
    If you already know what you are looking for, the easiest way to
    find it is to enter keywords in the ***How can we help?*** bar at
    the top.

-   **Tickets** - the best way to communicate with our Support
    Technicians and provide specific details about a problem that you
    are experiencing is by opening a ticket.  The advantage of using a
    ticket is that it allows you to copy & paste or attach (20 MB limit)
    cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log entries
    directly into the ticket.  As you can imagine, trying to communicate
    this information over the phone is problematic at best.

-   **Live Chat **- We have Support Technicians standing by 24 hours a
    day to answer any questions you have.  Under the Live Chat link, you
    will be directed into a Live Chat session with specialists trained
    to support our various products.  Choose the appropriate Live Chat
    link for the product you need assistance with.

With all the support resources and support staff made available to you,
it's no wonder why Rackspace is known as the home of Fanatical Support!
 This completes our tour of the Control Panel.
