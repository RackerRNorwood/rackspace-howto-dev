<p>After you have <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/guide_2" target="_self">created a new cloud server</a> with the control panel, your next step is to make a secure remote connection from your local computer to your cloud server. &nbsp;This article describes how to use a client called PuTTY to form an Secure Shell (SSH) connection from a computer running a Microsoft Windows OS to a Linux server.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For an OnMetal Server, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-onmetal-cloud-servers#uploadKey" target="_self">Uploading an SSH key</a> in the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-onmetal-cloud-servers" target="_blank">Using OnMetal Cloud Servers</a> article for applicable OnMetal steps.</li>
	<li>This procedure requires you to install PuTTY or another SSH client which you do at your own risk. &nbsp;PuTTY is not affiliated with Rackspace in any way, but their software is simple to use, is freely available, and reputable.</li>
	<li>If you are a Mac OS X user, you can <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/Mac_to_Linux_using_iTerm">connect to a Linux server by using Terminal</a>,&nbsp;a console program included with the operating system.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Windows_Versions" name="Windows_Versions"></a></p>

<h2>Windows versions</h2>

<p>The procedure and examples in this article use &nbsp;Windows XP, Service Pack 2. &nbsp;Different versions of Windows may have slightly different interfaces.<a id="Download_and_install" name="Download_and_install"></a></p>

<h2>Download PuTTY</h2>

<p>Download PuTTY from the <a class="external text" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">website</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to comply with the license requirements.</p>

<p>After you download PuTTY, launch the application.</p>

<h2>Configure you connection</h2>

<p>In the PuTTY Configuration window, enter the following values and then click <strong>Open</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the Host Name enter the IP address of your Cloud Server. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ensure the Connection Type is set to SSH. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>(<em>Optional</em>) In the Saved Sessions field, you can assign a name for this connection. &nbsp;Feel free to save it to whatever name you want: it simply saves time next time you use Putty. &nbsp;You can have a different name for each of your Cloud Servers.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Accept_key" name="Accept_key"></a></p>

<h2>Accept the key</h2>

<p><br />
If this is the first time that you have used PuTTY to log in to your server with SSH, a warning similar to the following one is displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c768825.r25.cf2.rackcdn.com/2_AcceptKey.png" /></p>

<p>If you are sure&nbsp;that you have entered the correct information, click <strong>Yes</strong>. &nbsp;<br />
Subsequent connections will not show this warning because the host key is now cached in the registry of your local computer. &nbsp;You can expect to see that warning, however, if you connect to your server from a different computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="Username_and_Password" name="Username_and_Password"></a></p>

<h2>Enter your username and password</h2>

<p>After you accept the warning, the terminal prompts you for your username and password.</p>

<p>If this is the first time that you are logging in to the server, you must log in as the root user.</p>

<p>When you are prompted for the password for the root user<strong>,</strong> enter the current root password for this server.&nbsp;When you enter this password at the prompt,&nbsp;it is not echoed to the screen. &nbsp;Then, press <strong>Enter</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have entered the correct root password, the prompt responds with a shell prompt:</p>

<p><code>[root@yourservername ~]#</code></p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c768825.r25.cf2.rackcdn.com/3_login.png" /></p>

<p>Now you can work on your server with all permissions.</p>

<p>Change your root passwords</p>

<p>FWe recommend that you change the root password to something personal. &nbsp;You can easily do this by using the passwd command.</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the shell prompt, enter the passwd command.</li>
	<li>Enter the new password that you want to set for your server. &nbsp;The password does not echo to the screen. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reenter the new password and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reenter the new password and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c768825.r25.cf2.rackcdn.com/4_passwd.png" /></p>

<p>You will now use this password with the root user whenever you connect to your server.</p>
