<p><strong>What is edge purge?</strong></p><p>When using the Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Cloud Files, your files are distributed across a global network of <em>edge servers</em>&nbsp;increasing the speed at which your audience can download files from your site. &nbsp; This is accomplished by the CDN automatically caching your files to an edge server after the first time it is requested from a given geographic region. &nbsp;Those files will remain cached on the edge server until such a time as the Time To Live (TTL) setting for an individual file expires, or until an edge purge request is sent to the node. &nbsp;</p><p>This can cause problems if your content is frequently updated or modified, and your audience may be downloading older files that are cached on the edge server. &nbsp;The edge purge function will clear the cache of a given edge server, and allow it to cache a newer version of a file after the first time it is requested from a given geographic area.&nbsp; Customers are allowed up to 25 object purges a day, per account.&nbsp; If a customer needs to purge an entire container, they can simply contact our Fanatical Support team for assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>Purging content from edge servers is a great feature to have for CDN, especially when you&rsquo;re really in a pickle. However, edge purge isn&rsquo;t your only option for controlling your content on the edge. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s review some best practices for when and when not to use edge purge to control your content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Work Flow</strong></p><p>In general, if you have purge as a part of your basic workflow, you probably have better options (see below). &nbsp;Purge should be used as a one-off method for controlling content, rather than a final step to uploading new content. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Updating user content</strong></p><p>If you are sending purges every time your site visitors update their profile, pictures, or other information, then you will likely be happier using a TTL setting to control when your content expires and is removed from the edge servers&#39; cache. &nbsp;The average purge request takes about 20 minutes to process, and sometimes hours, depending on activity levels. &nbsp;Your TTL can be set as low as 15 minutes. &nbsp;Give it a try, and we bet your site visitors will see better performance from their updates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Removing Content</strong></p><p>Possibly you have files hosted on the CDN that were set with a long TTL because you did not expect the content to be updated frequently. &nbsp;In a circumstance where you need to get those files removed from the edge node cache immediately, this is a great time to use the edge purge feature. &nbsp;If the TTL of your file is nowhere near expiration and you need to immediately remove some outdated or sensitive content, then purge is the right tool for you. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Releasing a new version of your product</strong></p><p>Sometimes developers want to wipe out their edge content so they can start fresh with updated content once a new release comes out. &nbsp;Something to keep in mind is that, in that type of situation, you are probably required to issue a ton of purge requests to refresh all data. &nbsp;All purge requests are put into one centralized queue, meaning you might be creating an unneccessarily high queue and slowing down the purging process. &nbsp;You should think about versioning your files instead of using identical file names for all your releases. &nbsp;This means you can instantly tell your website or application to request the new file, and the old one simply gets retired to Cloud Files. &nbsp;This also gives you the flexibility to launch at an exact time, rather than waiting on a purge to propagate the updated content. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Not sure if purge is the right way for you to control your CDN content? &nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a rule of thumb, try other plans first. &nbsp;If you can solve your needs by using a low TTL or versioning your objects, these are great first options. &nbsp;Of course, edge purge is always available as a last resort. &nbsp;Still not sure? &nbsp;Feel free to comment on this article, or contact one of our Fanatical Support&reg; reps. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re here to help!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
