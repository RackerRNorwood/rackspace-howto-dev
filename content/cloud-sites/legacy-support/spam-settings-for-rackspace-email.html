<p><span><span>If our spam filtering software suspects that an incoming message is spam, it will be sent to the Spam folder. However, in some cases spam messages may be delivered to your Inbox or some messages you want to receive may be delivered to the Spam folder. You can customize your spam filtering settings and level of filtering within webmail.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Blacklisting Users/Domains:</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Email sent to you from domains, email addresses, and IPs on your blacklist will be blocked and will not be delivered to your mailbox. To manage your blacklist, do the following:</span></span></p>

	<li><span><span>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Domains and email addresses that are blacklisted will appear in the&nbsp;<strong>Blacklisted Domains &amp; Email Addresses</strong>&nbsp;box.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Spam filtering tools work to detect and filter out spam.

<p><span><span>In the <strong>Spam Filtering</strong> section, you can turn spam filtering on or off. Or, you can turn on the <strong>Exclusive</strong> setting, which will allow you to receive incoming email only from addresses or IPs on your safelist. For more information about safelists, please see the specific topics related to safelists.</span></span></p>
