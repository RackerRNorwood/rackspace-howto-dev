<p><em>Detailed invoices</em>&nbsp;give you access to an itemized, per-service, per-device overview of your billing charges.</p>

	<li>In the upper-right corner of the page, click <strong>Account: <em>your Username</em> &gt; Billing and Payments.</strong></li>

<h3>Detailed invoice features</h3>

<p><em>Detailed invoices</em>&nbsp;are formatted similarly to a regular invoice, with one exception. Each service (for example, Cloud Servers) has a collapsible list of detailed line items. Detailed line items show the devices that use the service, indicated by the name given to the device when it was created.</p>

<p>To expand the list, click the arrow next to the service.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/detailedinvoiceexpand.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>When a service’s list is expanded, each item contains at least two lines. The first line indicates the total charges for the device. Any line under the first indicates an itemized price based on how the device was used.</p>

<p>For example, in the Cloud Servers list, the cost for the server named LinuxTEST is calculated from two items:&nbsp; Legacy Server Uptime and Legacy Server IP. The number in the first line is the sum of the two items under it.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/linuxtest.png" width="600" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want details about how a device’s use charge was calculated, place your cursor over the charge. A pop-up box appears next to the cursor with the equation used to calculate the charge.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/linuxequation.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>Lastly, at the top of the invoice is a collapsible list called <strong>Account</strong>. Account-level charges are the charges that are not specific to an individual device. This includes service specific charges such as bandwidth charges.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Although their format is similar, detailed invoices are displayed differently than the CSV format of invoices. The CSV format lists detailed line items specific to the <em>service</em>, even if that item is not <em>device</em> specific. If you cannot find a detailed line item associated with a service&nbsp;that was listed in the CSV format, look under <strong>Account&nbsp;</strong>in your detailed invoice.</p>
