<p>To work with your cloud server you must&nbsp;establish a connection to it from your local computer. How you make the connection depends on your server&nbsp;operating system and desktop&nbsp;operating system.</p>

<h2>Linux server</h2>

<p>Use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to your Linux server. For connection instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop operating system:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/1225">Connecting to Linux from Mac OS X by using Terminal</a></li>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/68">Connecting to Linux from Windows by using PuTTY</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you can't use SSH to access a Linux server remotely, you can access&nbsp;its command line by using the&nbsp;<a href="/knowledge_center/node/1356">console in the Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>

<h2>Windows server</h2>

<p>Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log in to your Windows server.&nbsp;For connection instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop operating system:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/368">Logging in to Your Server via RDP (Windows)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/371">Log in to your server with RDP (Mac)</a></li>
</ul>
