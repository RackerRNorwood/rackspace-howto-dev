<p>To tell Rackspace Intelligence which aspects of your configuration to monitor for you, you define your objectives in the following terms:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Entities</em> to be monitored<br />
	For example, you can define a cloud server as an entity.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Checks</em>&nbsp;that focus on a particular aspect of an entity's behavior<br />
	For example, a check can monitor a cloud server's RAM usage.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Alarms</em>&nbsp;that define the limits of the entity's behavior<br />
	For example, alarm criteria identify whether RAM usage is in one of the following states: OK, WARNING, or CRITICAL.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Alerts</em>&nbsp;that announce when a monitored entity has triggered an alarm<br />
	For example, an alert reports that RAM usage has reached the CRITICAL level.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Notification plans</em>&nbsp;that define how to communicate alerts<br />
	For example, a notification plan requests notification of the help desk and the on-call system administrator.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Notifications</em>&nbsp;that define the contact information used in notification plans<br />
	For example, notifications to the on-call system administrator are sent as text messages to a specific telephone number.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Visualizations</em>&nbsp;that present data meaningfully<br />
	For example, a RAM usage graph shows growth leading up to the triggered alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/cloud-monitoring/">“Single Pane of Glass” for Your IT Ops</a>&nbsp;discusses these concepts in the context of Cloud Monitoring. Rackspace Intelligence acts as a dashboard to help you interact with data collected by Cloud Monitoring.</p>
