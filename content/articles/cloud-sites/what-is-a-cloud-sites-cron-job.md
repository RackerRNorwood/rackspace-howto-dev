&ldquo;Cron&rdquo; is a scheduling service that enables you to execute a command or
a script automatically, at a specified date and time. You can create a
con job (also called a scheduled task) directly through your Rackspace
Cloud control panel.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Cron jobs that run over 900 seconds (15 minutes) are
automatically terminated.
