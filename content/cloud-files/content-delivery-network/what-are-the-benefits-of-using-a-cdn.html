<h4>Benefits of a CDN</h4><ul><li>Higher capacity and scale- Strategically placed servers increase the network backbone capacity and number of concurrent users handled. For instance, when there is a 10 Mbit/s network backbone and 100 Mbit/s central server capacity, only 10 Mbit/s can be delivered. But when 10 servers are moved to 10 edge locations, total capacity can be 10*10 Mbit/s.</li><li>Lower delivery costs - Strategically placed edge servers decrease the load on interconnects, public peers, private peers and backbones, freeing up capacity and lowering delivery costs. A CDN offloads traffic on a backbone network by redirecting traffic to edge servers.</li><li>Lower network latency and packet loss - End users experience less jitter and improved stream quality. CDN users can therefore deliver high definition content with high Quality of Service, low costs and low network load.</li><li>Higher Availability - CDNs dynamically distribute assets to strategically placed core, fallback and edge servers. CDNs may have automatic server availability sensing with instant user redirection. CDNs can thus offer 100% availability, even with large power, network or hardware outages.</li><li>Better Usage analytics â€“ CDNs can give more control of asset delivery and network load. They can optimize capacity per customer, provide views of real-time load and statistics, reveal which assets are popular, show active regions and report exact viewing details to customers</li></ul>
