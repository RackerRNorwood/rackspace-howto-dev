undefined&reg; Sharepoint and
Microsoft Exchange Server - Dedicated solutions. Rackspace also offers
on-demand Managed and Professional Services for customers with unique
requirements. In a Managed Colocation solution, customer
responsibilities include:    

-   Management of the operating systems and applications
-   Administration of the net devices (firewalls and load balancers)
-   Monitoring of the applications, operating systems and devices

Customers who choose [Managed
Colocation](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation/index.php)
typically do so because they want to maintain OS control but don't want
to be bogged down with the day-to-day routine of server management.
Managed Colocation from Rackspace offers a hosting solution that speaks
to your desired level of control but creates a much more user-friendly
experience compared to traditional colocation.
