<p class="p1">You can load balance incoming traffic to your domain using a Cloud Load Balancer. Suppose you initially&nbsp;have one Cloud Server with a domain pointing to the public IP Address of the server. Then traffic to your domain starts picking up and suddenly overloads your server. To improve traffic flow, you can create a clone of the server and then put both servers behind a new load balancer. Intead of pointing your domain directly to the old server, you can now point it to the new load balancer, which will distribute the traffic evenly and prevent server overload. Additionally, you could also create several new domains that point to the load balancer. &nbsp;</p><p class="p1">This article describes how to point an existing domain to a Cloud Load Balancer.
