<p>Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Office Control Panel! After you sign up for Microsoft Exchanges services through Rackspace, the first thing you'll want to do is log in to your Cloud Office Control Panel. This article provides a brief overview of the control panel, which you can access at <a href="https://cp.rackspace.com/">https://cp.rackspace.com/</a> for new Cloud Office customers or <a>https://my.rackspace.com/</a> for UK and MyRackspace customers.</p>

<p>Once you're logged into the Control Panel, you will see a variety of sections that showcase the products that you have signed up for (in this case Microsoft Exchange). Each product/service box has a variety of options and tools to choose from. Control Main includes <strong>Microsoft Exchange</strong> Product box,&nbsp;<strong>My Account</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Domains</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>News &amp; Alerts&nbsp;</strong>window.
