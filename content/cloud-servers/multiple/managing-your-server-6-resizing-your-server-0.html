<p>In this article, we dicuss the process for resizing your server - changing the RAM and disk space allocation. Note that at this time, Windows servers can be resized to a larger allocation but cannot be resized down to a lesser allocation.&nbsp; Only Standard Cloud Servers can be resized.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To allow you to easily scale your server by increasing the amount of Disk Space and RAM on your server, click the&nbsp;<strong>Resize</strong>&nbsp;button.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c765420.r20.cf2.rackcdn.com/8_Resizenew.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>You will see a pop-up window listing your server size options. &nbsp;Each server size has a different hourly cost for uptime, and the new cost goes into effect when the server resize process is completed.&nbsp; This could mean that you will pay different rates for the same server within a given billing cycle.&nbsp; Press the&nbsp;<strong>Resize Server</strong>&nbsp;button to begin.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Next you will choose your new&nbsp;<strong>Server Size</strong>.&nbsp; Each server size has a different hourly cost for uptime, and the new cost goes into effect when the server resize process is completed.&nbsp; This could mean that you will pay different rates for the same server within a given billing cycle. &nbsp;Note that Windows servers cannot be resized down, so smaller sizes will be grayed out. &nbsp;Press the&nbsp;<strong>Resize</strong>&nbsp;button to begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>You will see the&nbsp;<strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;change on the server details screen throughout the Resize process, going through modes such as&nbsp;<em>Preparing</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Queueing for Resize</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Verify the Resize.</strong>&nbsp; This is an important step because it is the last chance you will have to revert to the original size and cancel any changes to your server.&nbsp; You will receive a notification prompting you to verify the changes made to your system resources and to verify that there was no adverse impact to your server.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to remotely login to your server and verify your sytem resources and filesystem integrity.&nbsp; Do not rely on the availability of your website as an indicator of whether the resize was successful, as certain server processes may be suspended while the resize is waiting to be verified.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c765420.r20.cf2.rackcdn.com/14_ConfirmRollbacknew.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>For a Linux server, you can SSH to either the public or private IP address and run the commands 'df -h' (Hard Disk usage) and 'free -m' (available RAM memory) to verify the changes. &nbsp;Below you can see that my server, which previously had 10 GB of HD space and 256 MB of RAM, now has 20 GB of HD space and 500 MB of RAM.</li>
	<li><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>For a Windows server, there are additional steps required to use the additional space after a resize. &nbsp;Please follow the instructions from this article:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-disk-space-after-resizing-a-windows-server-2012-cloud-server">Adding Disk Space After Resizing a Windows Server 2012 Cloud Server</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Now that you've verified the system resources and checked your filesystems, you can choose to&nbsp;<strong>Confirm</strong>&nbsp;the resize or&nbsp;<strong>Revert</strong>&nbsp;to the original size. &nbsp;Choosing to Confirm the resize will change the server status.&nbsp; The process will be complete when the&nbsp;<strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;reads&nbsp;<strong>Active</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Current Action</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>None</strong>, and the server has come back up from a reboot.&nbsp; Any web services that you had running may require you to log in and manually restart them.</li>
</ul>
