The Cloud Control Panel lets you perform administrative tasks in as few
clicks as possible. This article describes the different methods for
performing server management tasks using the control panel.

Managing Server Types
---------------------

There are two server types that can be listed in this section:

-   Next Generation Cloud Servers powered by OpenStack.
-   First Generation Cloud Servers, our legacy Cloud Server offering.

For a comparison of features, click
[here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/next-gen-vs-first-gen-feature-comparison "Next Generation vs. First Generation Feature Comparison").

You can identify First Generation Cloud Servers in the Control Panel by
the blue asterisk that follows the server name:

You'll also notice you can filter your servers by **Type**:

Performing Management Tasks on Your Server
------------------------------------------

You can use either the Actions cog or Actions menu to perform management
operations on your Cloud Server.

### Using the Actions Cog

When you open the Cloud Control Panel or click Servers at the top of the
page, you'll see a list of your Cloud Servers. To the left of each
server name is the **Actions** cog. Click the cog to view the operations
you can perform on your server:

### Using the Actions Menu

If you click on a server, the Server Details page appears. In the upper
right corner of the page, you'll find the Actions menu. This menu
contains the same operations that are available in the Actions cog.

Server Management
-----------------

You can use the **Actions** cog or Actions menu to perform the following
server management tasks. 

### Identify Your Server

You can rename your server or add tags (descriptive labels) to it:

-   Click **Rename Server**to change the server name.
-   Click **Tag Server** to add new tags or remove existing tags.  For
    more information on tags, see [Using
    Tags](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/node/2286).

 

### Image and Recover Your Server

You can create an image of a server or rebuild a server from a
previously saved image:

-   Click **Create Image** to create a snapshot image of your server.
-   Click **Rebuild From Image** to overwrite your current server with a
    previousy saved image or a new image of your choosing. 

###  

### Manage Your Server

You can perform many of essential management tasks without logging
directly into your server:

-   **Connect Via Terminal** opens Linux shell window or Windows command
    prompt window so you can issue commands directly on your server..
-   **Reboot Server** without logging into it.
-   **Resize** **Server** to vertically scale your computing power (not
    available for all servers).
-   **Change Password** lets you change the root password on Linux
    servers or the Administrator password on Windows. **Note:** This
    command requires an automatic reboot of your server. Remember to
    save your data before issuing this command.
-   **Delete Server** lets you delete a server when you no longer need
    it. You will lose any saved data as well as the IP address assigned
    to the server.

 

Using the Edit Pencil
---------------------

When viewing the Server Details page for a particular server, you'll
notice a pencil icon next to items that are instantly configurable:

-   To **rebuild your server**, click the System Image pencil to rebuild
    your server from a default Rackspace image or a previously saved
    image.   
-   To **resize your sever**, click the Size pencil to dynamically
    resize your server.
