<p>RackConnect gives you the freedom to choose the best platform for your applications by unifying the breadth of the Rackspace portfolio into a single solution.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the Rackspace Cloud with your data center or existing IT infrastructure by using an encrypted VPN tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define network security policies in the customer portal, which are automatically applied and managed across your firewall, load balancer, and Cloud Servers.</p>
