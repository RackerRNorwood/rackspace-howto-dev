<p>Hosted Microsoft Lync is a unified communications tool that offers secure instant Mmessaging, video chat, file transfer, and presence to users from desktop and mobile devices. It is available as an add-on for&nbsp;Rackspace Hosted Exchange 2013 email platform.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of your organization and your IT infrastructure, the rollout of the Rackspace Hosted Lync service to your users will vary. The overall deployment plan has three basic steps, and this article is designed to help you decide the best rollout method for your environment.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="setupdns"></a>Set up DNS records for <strong>Lync </strong></strong></h3>

<p>As the first step, you must create Auto-discover entries on your DNS server. &nbsp;If you have an internal DNS you must also set up these records on your internal DNS.</p>

<p>We highly recommend that you perfor this step because all of the Hosted Lync features will work only if DNS is correctly configured. For instructions, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/set-up-dns-records-for-email-and-hosted-lync#LyncDNSSetUp">Hosted Lync DNS Records</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are a Rackspace Hosted Exchange customer, these settings are in addition to what you might currently have for Hosted Exchange Autodiscover.</p>

<h3><strong>Activate Lync for users in the Email Administrator Control Panel </strong></h3>

<p>You can enable Lync for your entire domain or only for selected users. In the Email Administrator Control Panel, click on the Lync hyperlink to go to the Lync page, and then select the check box next to the users to enable Lync for them.</p>

<h3>Deployment and distribute the client</h3>

<p>Depending on the complexity of your environment, you have various options for deploying Lync clients for desktops. The Lync 2013 client is part of the Microsoft Office Professional Plus bundle. You can also download a basic version for free.&nbsp;</p>
