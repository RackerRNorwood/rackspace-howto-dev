Rackspace Intelligence provides predefined graphs that represent the
activity of any entity that you choose during any time range that you
choose. To see these graphs, click **Visualize** at the top of the
interface, and then click **Default Graphs**.

If you choose a preset time range, Rackspace Intelligence shows data
collected for the entity during the most recent period of that range:

-   One hour
-   Eight hours
-   One day
-   One week
-   One month

If you choose a custom time range and click **Apply**, Rackspace
Intelligence shows data collected for the entity between the first and
last time stamp.
