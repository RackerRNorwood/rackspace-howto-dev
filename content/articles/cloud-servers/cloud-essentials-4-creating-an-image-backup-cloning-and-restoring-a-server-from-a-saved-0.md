This article guides you through the process of creating an image backup
(cloning).

**Note:****While you can create a different size server from that of the
saved image, you must still use the same base OS version. 

**Note:****The first part of the procedure takes you through creating a
snapshot image; if your snapshot image has already been created, you can
skip to [Restoring A Server From A Saved Image](#A).

1. Log into the Cloud Control Panel.
