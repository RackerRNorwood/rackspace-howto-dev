[![](/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/crp.png)](http://stories.rackspace.com/)At
Rackspace, we strive to provide each and every one of our customers with
extraordinary service, day in and day out. Known as [Fanatical
Support^&reg;^](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/), this
commitment to service is the foundation of our strong relationships with
our customers.

The Rackspace Customer Reference Program was created as a means of
deepening these relationships.

This program provides numerous ways for you to generate awareness for
your company and to showcase your brand in channels and markets you
might not otherwise access. It&rsquo;s also a way for your executives and
thought leaders to increase their visibility among industry peers.

For Rackspace, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to get to know you and your business
even better and to highlight how our customers have made us the company
we are today. There is no better way of telling the Rackspace story than
through the voices of our valued customers.
