<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>While enabling or disabling scheduled images can be done through the Cloud Control Panel, the control panel does not yet give you the ability to manage the images themselves. However, this can easily be done from the command line by using python-novaclient.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll explain how to use the python-novaclient tool to manage all aspects of scheduled images, both enabling/disabling scheduled images on a server (which you can do in the control panel) and managing the images (which you can't). Let's start by describing the scheduled images feature so we can work from a common vocabulary.</p>

<h2>Scheduled Images</h2>

<p>The scheduled images feature of the Rackspace Open Cloud allows you to have automatic weekly or daily&nbsp;snapshots taken of any of your servers. Just pick a server and enable the feature.</p>

<p>The feature is very simple. The only options are: (1) the day of the week you'd like a weekly image created, and (2) a "retention" value, which is the maximum number of scheduled snapshot images of that particular server you want to retain in your account. Once this number is exceeded, the scheduled images service will delete the oldest scheduled snapshot image of that server so that the number of scheduled images doesn't exceed your retention setting. You can change the retention value at any time. You won't see the effects of a change until the next time a scheduled image is added to your account.</p>

<p>Once you've enabled scheduled images on some of your servers you'll start accumulating them in your account. The retention setting allows you to keep the number of daily images down to a reasonable level, but there might be circumstances where you want more control over snapshot retention. Suppose you want a retention value of 7, but would also like to save the first scheduled image that was taken this month? For that you'll need to use either the API or python-novaclient command-line interface for the API.</p>

<p>Let's look at getting python-novaclient set up for that purpose.</p>

<h2>Setting up python-novaclient</h2>

<p>First, if you haven't used python-novaclient before, take a look at one of these Knowledge Center articles:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-python-novaclient-on-linux-and-mac-os" target="_blank">Installing python-novaclient on Linux and Mac OS</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-python-novaclient-on-windows" target="_blank">Installing python-novaclient on Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These articles will provide you with an overview of python-novaclient and complete instructions for installing it on your operating system of choice. They also suggest that you install the special "rackspace-novaclient" package which will install python-novaclient plus all the extensions supported in the Rackspace Open Cloud. (In order to get the scheduled images extension, you need to make sure you install rackspace-novaclient version &gt;= 1.3) If you <em>already</em> have a python-novaclient installed, you can use pip to install <em>only&nbsp;</em>the scheduled images extension:</p>

<pre>
sudo pip install rax_scheduled_images_python_novaclient_ext
</pre>

<p>If you previously used the python-novaclient with daily scheduled images, and you want to take advantage of weekly scheduled images, you can upgrade your installation to the latest version of the scheduled images extension:</p>

<pre>
sudo pip install --upgrade rax_scheduled_images_python_novaclient_ext</pre>

<h2>Using the Scheduled Images Feature</h2>

<p>Once you have the Rackspace scheduled images extension installed for python-novaclient, it's a snap to manage scheduled images on your servers. Let's suppose your server ID is "24ade2fe-60d9-4d3e-a02c-c9a6a1b588a6" and its name is "myserver".</p>

<h3>Enable scheduled images for a server</h3>

<p>To enable weekly scheduled images for a server, use this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable --day-of-week {day}  {server}  {retention}
</pre>

<p>For&nbsp;<code>{server}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of your server. For <code>{day}</code>&nbsp;use one of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>saturday, sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday.&nbsp;</code>For&nbsp;<code>{retention}</code>, specify the number of scheduled images you want to retain in your account for this server. The retention must be a positive integral value.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to enable weekly scheduled images on our example server, and you want to keep at least a month's worth around. &nbsp;You'd issue this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable --day-of-week saturday  24ade2fe-60d9-4d3e-a02c-c9a6a1b588a6  4</pre>

<p>To enable daily scheduled images for a server, use this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable  {server}  {retention}
</pre>

<p>For <code>{server}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of your server. For <code>{retention}</code>, specify the number of scheduled images you want to retain in your account for this server. The retention must be a positive integral value.</p>

<p>If you want to enable daily scheduled images on our example server, and you want to keep at least a week's worth around, you'd issue this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable  24ade2fe-60d9-4d3e-a02c-c9a6a1b588a6  7
</pre>

<h3>Disable scheduled images for a server</h3>

<p>To turn off scheduled images for a server, use this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-disable  {server}
</pre>

<p>For <code>{server}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of your server. Any scheduled snapshots of this server currently in your account will remain there; you can delete them using whatever technique you currently use to delete images.</p>

<h3>Change the day of the week for weekly scheduled images</h3>

<p>To change the day of the week your weekly scheduled images are being created, just enable scheduled images on that server again, specifying the new day of the week and the retention value you want to use. &nbsp;For example,</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable  --day-of-week sunday  myserver  4
</pre>

<p>will enable weekly&nbsp;scheduled images on "myserver" where the image will be created on Sunday and the retention value is 4.</p>

<h3>Change the retention value on a server</h3>

<p>To update the retention value for a server, just enable scheduled images on that server again, using whatever value you want to change the retention to. &nbsp;Note that if you're using weekly scheduled images, you must specify the day of week when you issue the command. &nbsp;(Otherwise, the novaclient will think that you want to switch to a daily schedule.) &nbsp;&nbsp;For example,</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable  --day-of-week saturday  myserver  8
</pre>

<p>will set a retention value of 8&nbsp;on the example server, with scheduled images continuing to be taken weekly on Saturday.</p>

<p>If you're using daily scheduled images and you want to change the retention value, you'd use this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-enable  myserver  31
</pre>

<p>It will set a retention value of 31 on the example server with images being created daily (since no day of the week was specified).</p>

<h3>Checking the image schedule on a server</h3>

<p>If you are setting different retention values on several servers according to how important they are, it's easy to lose track of their retention values. If you want to see what the current retention value is on a server, use this command:</p>

<pre>
nova scheduled-images-show  {server}
</pre>

<p>For <code>{server}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of your server. (You can use this command even if scheduled imaging is not enabled for the server.) &nbsp;The output for this&nbsp;command will tell you whether you have weekly or daily images scheduled for this server and what your retention value is:</p>

<pre>
Schedule type: Weekly on: SATURDAY
Retention: 8
</pre>

<p>If you currently have daily scheduled images set on the&nbsp;server, you would&nbsp;see:</p>

<pre>
Schedule type: Daily
Retention: 31
</pre>

<p>If scheduled images aren't enabled on that server at all, you'll receive an error message:</p>

<pre>
ERROR (NotFound): Scheduled images not enabled for server 24ade2fe-60d9-4d3e-a02c-c9a6a1b588a6 (HTTP 404)
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Managing Scheduled Images</h2>

<p>You now know how to turn scheduled images on and off for each of your servers, and how to set or change the retention value for each. Now let's take a look at how to manage your scheduled images.</p>

<p>Scheduled images are basically no different from "regular" snapshot images, so if you want to remove some of them, you can use whatever technique you currently use (control panel, novaclient, API requests) to delete them.</p>

<h3>To Prevent a Scheduled Image from Being Deleted Automatically</h3>

<p>Scheduled images do have some extra information attached to them as metadata. In particular, they have a piece of metadata that indicates they were created by the scheduled images service. The scheduled images service looks at this metadatum when it computes how many scheduled images of a particular server are currently in your account; it compares this result to the retention value for that server and decides how many scheduled images should be deleted, starting with the oldest images.</p>

<p>To prevent an image from being deleted or counted by the scheduled images service, you can use the nova client to remove the 'org.openstack__1__created_by' metadatum that flags it as a scheduled image:</p>

<pre>
nova  image-meta  {image}  delete  org.openstack__1__created_by
</pre>

<p>For <code>{image}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of the image. There is no response if this call is successful.</p>

<h3>To See if a Scheduled Image is Subject to Being Deleted Automatically</h3>

<p>Once you start managing your images, you need a way to see which are subject to automatic deletion and which aren't. You can determine this by using the regular novaclient "image-show" command and looking for the created-by metadatum:</p>

<pre>
nova image-show {image}
</pre>

<p>For <code>{image}</code>, you can use either the UUID or the name of the image. Here's an example (abbreviated) response:</p>

<pre>
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Property                              | Value                                |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| status                                | ACTIVE                               |
| updated                               | 2013-05-10T17:39:08Z                 |
| name                                  | Daily-myserver-1368176524            |
| metadata instance_uuid                | 24ade2fe-60d9-4d3e-a02c-c9a6a1b588a6 |
| metadata org.openstack__1__created_by | scheduled_images_service             |
| progress                              | 100                                  |
| id                                    | d615a437-aaa9-4a52-a1c0-5bcb0d33038c |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
</pre>

<p>If the image detail response contains a row with property 'metadata org.openstack__1__created_by' and value 'scheduled_images_service', then this image may be removed by the scheduled images service. If such a row is missing, or the value of the property is something other than 'scheduled_images_service', then the scheduled images service will <em>not</em> delete the image. Note that you can tell which server this image is a snapshot of by looking at the value in the 'instance_uuid' metadata field.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we explained how to use python-novaclient (with the Rackspace scheduled images extension) to manage scheduled images. &nbsp;We looked at enabling and disabling weekly and daily&nbsp;scheduled images on a server, which can be done with the Cloud Control Panel as well as python-novaclient. &nbsp;We also discussed preventing a scheduled image from being automatically deleted when the number of scheduled images in your account exceeds the retention count for that server, which can only be done through the API or python-novaclient.</p>
