You can use Rackspace Intelligence to help you observe the status of
your database if you set up the database to be visible to Rackspace
Intelligence. You can do this through the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) by following these steps:

1.  Create a database. For instructions on creating a database at the
    command-line by using the trove client, see [Create Your First Cloud
    Database](http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-getting-started/content/Create_Cloud_Database.html).<br>
      
2.  Establish monitoring checks and alarms for the database as described
    in [Monitoring Cloud Databases in the Cloud Control
    Panel](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-cloud-databases-in-the-cloud-control-panel).
