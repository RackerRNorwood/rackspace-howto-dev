<p>POP email is typically stored locally on a computer and removed from the mail server after being downloaded by the client. &nbsp;In many cases, this data cannot be migrated with our migration tool when it does not exist on your source mail server. &nbsp;The steps in this article will walk you through performing a manual migration of POP data via Outlook to a Rackspace Email setup via POP.</p><p>We'll accomplish this task by changing the POP settings on your account. The change will allow you to easily use all of the locally stored email with your new Rackspace Email account. &nbsp;Once the new server is added, mail sent to Rackspace will start to arrive in the same Inbox.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about the differences between POP and IMAP, please see the help topic,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-email-imap-vs-pop">IMAP vs. POP</a>.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>Before performing the steps below, make sure that mailboxes have already been created on the Rackspace environment and that the MX records have been updated so to that email is routing correctly to Rackspace. &nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-rackspace-email-mailboxes">How to create mailboxes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/updating-your-mx-records-microsoft-exchange">How to change MX records</a></li></ul><h3>Changing Settings</h3><p>For increased security, we recommend that you use our secure (SSL) servers, as detailed below. If your internal system configurations require non-SSL ports, those settings are available in the article referenced previously,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-email-imap-vs-pop">IMAP vs. POP</a>.</p><ol><li><p>In Outlook 2010 select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If you're adding a new account click <strong>New</strong>. &nbsp;If you're changing your existing POP account, highlight the account and select <strong>Change</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Enter your name and email address, POP3 for the Account Type, "secure.emailsrvr.com" for the Incoming and Outgoing mail servers, and your User Name and Password.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/settings_screen%20copy_1.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="312" /></p><p>Check the <strong>Remember Password</strong> box if you don't want to type your password each time you launch Outlook.</p></li><li><p>Click the <strong>More Settings</strong> button.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>Outgoing Server</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p></li><li><p>Check the <strong>My Outgoing Server (SMTP) Requires Authentication</strong> box.</p></li><li><p>Leave the default setting - <strong>Use Same Settings as My Incoming Mail Server</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> Tab.</p></li><li><p>Set the Incoming server port to 995 and the Outgoing server port to 465, and&nbsp;<strong>Enable SSL Encryption</strong>.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Ports%20copy_0.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="273" /></p></li><li><p>A POP connection normally removes email messages from the server when they are downloaded. If you would like to leave copies on the server, select the <strong>Leave a copy of messages on server</strong> check box. To avoid exceeding your accountâ€™s storage limits, indicate whether the server should delete messages after a certain number of days and/or delete messages when you manually delete them from the Deleted Items folder.</p></li><li><p>Once the settings have been updated, navigate to your Inbox and hit the Send/Receive button. &nbsp;New emails that have been sent to your Rackspace account should now start appearing in your Inbox.</p></li></ol><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This process will not store your old emails on our servers. &nbsp;It will only allow you to consolidate those emails with your new emails while using the same Inbox in Outlook.</p><p>After the change, your email will look very similar to your previous setup.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/2013-11-27_1232.png" alt="" width="435" height="600" /></p>
