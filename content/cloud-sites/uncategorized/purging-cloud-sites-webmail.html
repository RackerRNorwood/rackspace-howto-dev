<p>1.&nbsp; Log into your webmail account.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Go to the webmail settings (3 lines on upper left corner).</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; In the General Settings tab you will go to the Email Options section and deselect the following options:</p>

<p>-Move deleted email to the Trash folder<br />
-Move purged email to the Trash folder</p>

<p>Once you have saved the changes you can then delete or purge messages.&nbsp; If you would like to see which folders contain the most messages you can go to the "Folder Manager", which is the gold button next to the Inbox.&nbsp; This will provide you with the option to "Update Sizes" as well as purge folders.</p>
