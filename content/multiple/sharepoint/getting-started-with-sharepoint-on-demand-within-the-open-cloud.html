<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Rackspace offers Cloud Servers images that include SharePoint and SQL Server pre-installed. These images have been specifically designed to meet the needs of SharePoint users who&nbsp;are interested in easily deploying a&nbsp;SharePoint instance for testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sharepoint Images</h2>
<p><strong>SharePoint Foundation 2010 with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MS SQL Express 2008 R2</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MS SQL Standard 2008 R2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SharePoint Foundation 2013 with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MS SQL 2012 Standard&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>During the instance build, SharePoint Foundation 2010, MS SQL Express 2008 R2, or MS SQL Standard 2008 R2 are installed in a standalone or farm&nbsp;configuration based on which image is selected.&nbsp;A default web application and site collection have been created on a TCP port 80 and is accessible by the local Administrator account.&nbsp;The Windows Firewall has been configured to prevent external access to both TCP ports 80 and 443. If you would like to allow external access to those ports, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. First thing you'll do is login&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<ins></ins><strong>Admini</strong><strong>strator</strong>,&nbsp;select&nbsp;<ins></ins><strong>Start</strong>, and then open up your&nbsp;<ins></ins><strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Next, enter the following string:</p>
<pre>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 80" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 443" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=443<br /><br /></pre>
<p>Optionally on Windows 2012 you can launch the Windows PowerShell from the task bar and enter the following string:<br /><br /></p>
<pre>New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Open Port 443" -Action Allow -Direction Inbound -Enabled True -LocalPort 443 -Protocol TCP
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Open Port 80" -Action Allow -Direction Inbound -Enabled True -LocalPort 80 -Protocol TCP</pre>
<p>3. Next, open your preferred browser and head directly to your server's URL (e.g. http://example.com). Enter&nbsp;your Administrator credentials to access the default web application.</p>
<p>The Central Administration service has been configured and is running on a random port on via your cloud server. To access it, start a remote desktop session with your cloud server, login as the <strong>Administrator</strong>, select <strong>Start (</strong>or enter the Start Screen on Windows 2012<strong>)</strong>, then select <strong>SharePoint Central Administration</strong> from the menu. A browser window will open to the correct URL and port.</p>
