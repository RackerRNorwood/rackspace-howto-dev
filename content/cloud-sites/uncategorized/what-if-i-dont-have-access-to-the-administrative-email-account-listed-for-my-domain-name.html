<p>You must have access to the administrative email to approve transfer requests when you are changing registrars or updating your name servers. Your current registrar will send an email to this account that will require a reply from you, confirming that the transfer is authorized. If you do not have access to this email address, please contact <a href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do" title="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do" class="external text" rel="nofollow">customer support</a> for help.</p><p>You can also do a WHOIS search to find the administrative email and the current registar for a domain. See <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_do_a_WHOIS_search%3F" title="How do I do a WHOIS search?">How do I do a WHOIS search?</a> for more information.</p>
