<h2>Pre-Migration Tasks</h2>
<ol><ol>
<li>If the procedure is followed correctly, site impact during the migration process should be minimal. We suggest that you perform this migration at a non-peak time to minimize business impact.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>To limit the traffic to your database, set your site's default page to reflect that it is currently undergoing maintenance.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Confirm that your current hosting plan has an adequate number of databases allotted. You might need to add additional databases to the plan to perform this migration successfully.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>If you created any full text catalogs, you will have to drop them before making a backup of your 2005 database. While SQL 2008 does support full text catalogs, our current tools do not allow for them to be restored if they are in the backup file. Once you have restored to the new MSSQL2008 location please add your full text catalogs. The information at the following links will assist you in completing this task:

</ul>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You can set the database to <code>READ-ONLY</code> mode to ensure there are no updates done to the database while the migration is performed with the below query <strong>(Only set the database to READ_ONLY after making the backup, otherwise you won't be able to log into the new database)</strong>:
<pre>       <strong>ALTER DATABASE [NumXYZ_OldDbName] SET READ_ONLY</strong></pre>
</li>
<li>When the new database is restored set it to Read-Write:
<pre>       <strong>ALTER DATABASE [NumXYZ_NewDbName] SET READ_WRITE</strong></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cloud Site migration steps</h2>
<ol><ol>
<li>Create a new MSSQL 2008 database in the Cloud Sites Control Panel under the "Features" tab of the domain your MSSQL2005 database is on.

</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>After the database has been created, please view its properties (as shown below) and <strong>note the change in the hostname</strong>. <strong>You will need to change any connection strings you have to the database and this information will be required.</strong> The information for you database will vary from the image depending on what data center your account is hosted in. <img src="http://c0476992.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dbinfo.JPG" alt="dbinfo.JPG" /></li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Next use the web based admin tool, MyLittleAdmin, to back up your MSSQL 2005 database. The link for the online tool can be found in your Cloud Sites Control Panel by clicking on the database under the “Features” tab. For this backup please add "mlb" to the end of the URL. It is important to add this to the URL and not to go through the standard MyLittleAdmin link found in your Cloud Sites Control Panel. Using the links instead of adding the “mlb” may cause session issues between the two MyLittleAdmin versions. For example: <code>https://mssqladmin.websitesettings.com/mlb</code>
<p><img src="http://c0476992.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/mlb1.JPG" alt="mlb1.JPG" /></p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Login to your original MSSQL 2005 source database.
<p><img src="http://c0476992.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/mlb2.JPG" alt="mlb2.JPG" /></p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Now back up your MSSQL 2005 database use the MyLittleAdmin tool. When the backup has completed click on the file link to save the backup file to your local machine.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Log in to the MyLittleAdmin link again using your MSSQL 2008 database and login. Remember the login you use to restore will become the new owner of the database. Choose restore and upload the backup file you just downloaded in Step 5. Proceed with the restore.
<p><img src="http://c0476992.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/mlb3.JPG" alt="mlb3.JPG" /></p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>The restore tool may notify you that the old users have no login mapping on the new SQL 2008 cluster. At this point your new database will be ready. The only access, at this point, is allowed to the owner login that you used to restore the database. If you need to change the owner to another login you created in the control panel or remap users in your database to new logins please refer to the KB article <a class="mw-redirect" title="How to Change ownership and remap database users using the web based admin tool for MSSQL." href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_to_change_ownership_or_remap_database_users_in_myLittleAdmin">How to Change ownership and remap database users using the web based admin tool for MSSQL.</a></li>
</ol></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the migration is complete, update all connection strings to point to the new database. After you verify that everything is working from the MSSQL2008 database, delete your MSSQL2005 database and confirm with <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/product-page/cloud-sites">Cloud Sites Support</a> that the migration is complete. This will ensure that you are not billed for the additional database in the future.</li>
