    billing for it, follow these directions to do so:

\
 1. Log into your control panel at
[https://manage.rackspacecloud.com](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com "https://manage.rackspacecloud.com")

2. Click on "Hosting."

3. Click on the domain you want to enable/disable client billing on.

4. Click on the "Change Plan" link in the "Traffic and Disk Space"
section.

5. Check/Uncheck the "Bill client for this site" option.

6. Review the hosting plan on the domain.
