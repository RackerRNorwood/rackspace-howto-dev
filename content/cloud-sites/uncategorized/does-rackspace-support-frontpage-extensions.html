<p>Unfortunately, we do not support FrontPage Extensions. While still used on many sites, Microsoft has discontinued support for FrontPage and has replaced it with a new set of technologies.</p><p>Please see <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/frontpage/default.aspx" title="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/frontpage/default.aspx" class="external text" rel="nofollow">this link</a> for additional information from Microsoft.</p>
