Rackspace gives our users the flexibility to set their own Spam
preferences to their liking. This includes editing and managing
domain-wide spam settings, Safe list, Black List and the ability to
override the spam filtering for the entire domain. Let's take a look at
how to manage this:

 

-   [Managing Domain Spam Settings](#ManageDomain)
-   [Managing Safe List](#SafeList)
-   [Managing Black List](#Blacklist)
-   [Managing Individual User Spam Settings](#Individual)

 

 

### Manage Domain Spam Settings

-   To manage your domain level spam settings select **Filter Settings**
    under **Domains**.

**Note:** If you have multiple domains, you will be prompted to select
which domain to edit.

 

-   In the Settings section select whether you'd like to turn the spam
    filtering on or off. You may also select the Exclusive button to
    receive email only from senders on your domain&rsquo;s safelist if you
    desire.
-   Next, select the preferred settings for your domain from the
    available options.

### Rackspace Email Handling

####  Email Handling Options:

-   Deliver to Spam folder: Messages marked as *Spam* are sent to your
    Spam folder. 

-   To automatically delete messages from this folder, select the
    checkbox next to: ***Delete after [    ] days or [    ] total
    email*** and enter a specific number of days and/or total emails in
    the blanks.

-   Delete the email immediately: Spam email will be deleted
    automatically instead of delivered to your mailbox.

-   Include "[SPAM]" at the beginning of the subject line - Spam email
    will be delivered to your Inbox, but will include the text "[SPAM]"
    in the *Subject* line.

-   Deliver to the email address: Spam messages are sent to an email
    address of your choice that resides on your domain. 

####  Override Options: {style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"}

-   In the **Override Options** section indicate whether to apply these
    settings to users who have not already set their spam preferences,
    or if these settings should override spam preferences for all users.
    When finished click the **Save** button.
