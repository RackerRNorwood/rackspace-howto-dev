<p>Cloud Feeds archives your events, based on region, by storing the data in a Cloud Files container in a particular region. Archiving enables you to store your events for a longer time period in case you need to support security or compliance auditing.</p>

<p>You can elect to have your events stored in one or more Cloud Files containers. During the archiving process, events are written to files and are organized by date, feed, and region. Files are formatted as a static feed page for a single day for a single feed in a region. You can walk through your archived feeds (similar to regular feeds) by using next-archive and prev-archive links that point to the next and previous days.</p>

<p>Cloud Feeds provides the following options for storing the archive data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Store all data at a default location, which is specified as one default container URL. With this option, feeds from all worldwide regions are stored in a single Cloud Files container in a single region.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Store the data dependent on a specified region. For example, an event originating from the LON region is stored in a Cloud Files container in LON, and an event originating from the SYD region is stored in a Cloud Files container in SYD. This option requires you to specify an archive container URL for each region. Events can also be configured to be stored in any arbitrary region.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Store some of the data at the default location, and some of the data at a specific, region-based container URL.</li>
</ul>
