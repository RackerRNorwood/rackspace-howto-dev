<p>You can import data into and export data from your archive in Cloud Office.</p>

<h2>Importing Data</h2>

<p>If you want to import data, create a request ticket in your control panel and include your domain name in the request. Rackspace will gather the necessary information and provide you with the best import method.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fee for data imports is $6 per GB of data. For information about import completion times, see the section at the end of this article.</p>

<h2>Exporting data</h2>

<p>You can use the following methods to export your data from your Rackspace Archiving account:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to export the results of a search, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office">Export archive search results in Cloud Office</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note:</strong> You can&nbsp;export searches with a maximum of 15,000 results and the total size of 3.5 GB&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you want to get a bulk export of your archived data, we can perform the export and provide you with links from which you can download your data directly.&nbsp;If you have access to an FTP site, provide your credentials and we can export your data to the FTP site.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pricing for a bulk&nbsp;export is a one-time fee of $6 per GB for EML format and $9 per GB for PST format.</p>

<p>When determining which export method to use, consider the following questions:</p>

<h3><strong>Is an external third party requesting these exports?</strong></h3>

<p>Providing a temporary login for third parties to review search results is much faster than requesting a bulk&nbsp;export.</p>

<h3><strong>To which format do you need to export?</strong></h3>

<p>We offer bulk exports in either PST or EML format. Although PST is a more well-known format, exporting in EML tends to be easier to search, faster for us to produce, and much cheaper. We recommend that you first determine whether&nbsp;there is a preferred format. If there is no preferred format, then we recommend using EML.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you need to export all data or only data that meets certain criteria?</strong></h3>

<p>In most cases, more data means a longer&nbsp;and more expensive export. We can export data that meets certain criteria, such as&nbsp;search, date, range, or mailbox users.</p>

<p>You can also provide search names based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Date</li>
	<li>Search term</li>
	<li>Subject</li>
	<li>Sender</li>
	<li>Recipient</li>
	<li>Words or attachments in the body</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time frames for importing and exporting data</h2>

<p>Following are the&nbsp;completion times for both importing and exporting:</p>
