<p>The following article will demonstrate how to setup the BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) with your Microsoft Exchange email account on your mobile device. Let's take a look at the guide below:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>&nbsp;A BES data plan must be purchased through your provider and added to your account; your administrator will then purchase a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/activesync_bes_license">BES license</a>&nbsp;and assign to your email address and provide you with an activation pin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>&nbsp;<em>Some of the steps may vary depending on your OS (Operating System). We've showcased OS5 &amp; OS6 since they're the most commonly used OS' at the moment.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Important Note:&nbsp;We are currently investigating BES10 and awaiting official hosting guidance from Blackberry. Once we have this information we will conduct testing to ensure our BES10 offering has the same Fanatical Support you expect from Rackspace. To date, Blackberry has not released an estimated date to distribute this information. In the meantime, please feel free to continue using ActiveSync.</em></p>
