The company who serves as your domain registrar is responsible for
managing your domain registration records. Your domain registrar is
often the company who sold you your domain name. Register.com, GoDaddy,
and TuCows are examples of popular domain registrars. Typically, you'll
contact your registrar (or log in to their website) in order to renew
your domain name, change your name servers, or update your contact
information. If you purchased your domain name through us, we serve as
your domain registrar. We also serve as your domain registrar if you
elected to transfer your domain name to us. If don't know where you
bought your domain name or who serves as your registrar, you can find
out by doing a WHOIS search.
