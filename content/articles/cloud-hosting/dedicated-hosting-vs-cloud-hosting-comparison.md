Rackspac&reg; offers both dedicated and cloud hosting solutions. Deciding
which is best for your particular scenario can be difficult. Following
are important features to consider when choosing a hosting solution for
your business.

 

Product or Service

Dedicated

Cloud Managed Operations service level

Cloud Managed Infrastructure service level

Support level

Dedicated hosting includes unlimited Fanatical Support for all supported
products, services, and software.

The Cloud Managed Operations service level includes support of the
datacenter environment, host server hardware, and Internet connectivity.

Managed Operations support also gives Rackspace employees direct server
access to perform troubleshooting and configuration of supported
applications for
[Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-operations-support-for-linux)
and
[Windows](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-operations-support-for-windows).

The Cloud Managed Infrastructure service level includes support of
datacenter environment, host server hardware, and Internet connectivity
only.

Rackspace employees are prohibited from logging in to customers' servers
to provide systems administration support.

Firewall

Dedicated firewalls are available as an option, and are a strongly
recommended security precaution.

Optional dedicated firewall if using RackConnect.

Monitoring

RackWatch monitoring is included and is enabled by default for PING
service checks. Upon request, six additional service checks and one free
URL monitor can be configured.

Managed Operations includes several checks and alerts through the Cloud
Monitoring service. Support helps you with the creation and
configuration of monitoring checks.

 

Monitoring is not preconfigured for Managed Infrastructure, but Cloud
Monitoring can be manually set up after server creation. There is no
charge for the Cloud Monitoring service.

Without a third-party monitoring solution or use of the Cloud Monitoring
service, you are not notified when individual services on your cloud
server stop working. You are notified only if the host server where your
cloud server is located is impacted.

Backups

Managed Backup is an optional service that captures file-level server
images. There is a backup limitation of 1.5 TB per server unless you are
using the optional High Capacity Backup service.  Database and Exchange
Backup agents are available for an additional charge.  Service extends
to database flat file dumps and maintenance plans. 

The file-level Cloud Backup service is available to Managed
Infrastructure customers for the price of storage on Cloud Files and any
bandwidth used if backup data is sent between regions..

Snapshots are an alternative backup approach at the system level.  Daily
snapshot scheduling is not enabled by default but can be manually
configured. Customers should perform database backups before creating an
image.

Our file-level Cloud Backup service is available to Cloud Servers for
the price of storage on Cloud Files and any bandwidth used if backup
data is sent between regions.

Cloud Server snapshot images are an alternative approach at the system
level. Customers should perform database backups before creating an
image.

Daily snapshot scheduling is not enabled by default and can be manually
configured when the server is created.

Server snapshot images are stored on Cloud Files.

Bandwidth

Dedicated servers include a specific amount of bandwidth.

Additional bandwidth is available at prepaid rates (bandwidth overage
rates apply if your subscription is exceeded).

Outgoing bandwidth is not included unless your solution includes
RackConnect. If the server is set up with RackConnect, the cloud servers
can consume any available bandwidth included in the dedicated
configuration.

If the server is not set up with RackConnect, you are charged for
outgoing bandwidth only.

Outgoing bandwidth is not included unless your solution includes
RackConnect. If the server is set up with RackConnect, the cloud servers
can consume any available bandwidth included in the dedicated
configuration.

If the server is not set up with RackConnect, you are charged only for
outgoing bandwidth.
