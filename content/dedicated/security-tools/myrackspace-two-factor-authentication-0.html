<p>Two-factor authentication uses an extra device, like a mobile phone, to provide an additional layer of security when you access your account. Two-factor authentication is a significant security improvement over using a password alone. This article explains how to manage two-factor authentication for your MyRackspace account from the <a href="myrackspace.com">MyRackspace</a> portal.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must be an administrative user to manage two-factor authentication for your MyRackspace account.</p>

<h2>Set up two-factor authentication for users</h2>

<p>An administrative user of the account can decide whether to make two-factor authentication a requirement for all users of the account or allow users to choose whether they want to use two-factor authentication.</p>

<p>With the <strong>Two-factor login administration</strong> option, you can decide whether to make two-factor authentication a requirement for all users or allow users to choose whether or not they want to use two-factor authentication.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/">MyRackspace portal</a>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>In the top menu bar, click <strong>Account</strong> and then select <strong>User List</strong>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>At the top of the User List page, click <strong>Two-Factor Login Administration</strong>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>On the Two-Factor Login page, select one of the following options:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Required for all users on this account</strong>—Makes two-factor authentication a requirement for all users on your account. Setup must take place on each user's next login.<br /><br /></li>
      <li><strong>Optional per user</strong>—Makes two-factor authentication optional for all users on your account. Users who want to use two-factor authentication are prompted to register a paired SMS-capable device on their next login.<br /><br /></li>

<h2>Register a device after two-factor authentication is enabled for your account</h2>

<p>If two-factor authentication is enabled for your user account, you must register a new SMS-capable device to pair with your account by using these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the <a href="https://myrackspace.com">MyRackspace portal</a>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Enter the phone number of your SMS-capable device to begin the device registration process.
      <p>You will receive an SMS or text message with a 4-digit PIN code.</p><br /></li>
  <li>To complete verification of your device, enter the 4-digit PIN code.
  <p>After your PIN is successfully entered and accepted, you are granted access to MyRackspace.</p></li>
</ol>

<a id="login"> </a>

<h2>Log in with two-factor authentication</h2>

<p>If you have a registered device paired with your account, a 7-digit verification code is sent via SMS text message to your device after you log in to the MyRackspace portal with your username and password. This verification code is the second factor of authentication for accessing the portal.</p>

<p>Enter the correct verification code to complete two-factor authentication to the <a href="https://myrackspace.com">MyRackspace portal</a>.</p>

<h2>Troubleshoot two-factor authentication problems</h2>

<p>Following are a few common problems that you might encounter when setting up two-factor authentication and some basic troubleshooting steps that can help you overcome them.</p>

<h3>Invalid phone number</h3>

<p>When trying to register a mobile device, you might receive an error indicating an invalid phone number. Confirm that a valid 10-digit phone number has been entered correctly with no extra characters or spaces.</p>

<h3>Verify device - Invalid PIN<h3>

<p>When attempting to verify your mobile device, you might receive an error that the PIN entered is incorrect. Confirm that the correct 4-digit PIN received via SMS text message has been entered correctly.</p>

<h3>MyRackspace account locked</h3>

<p>After you log in to the <a href="https://myrackspace.com">MyRackspace portal</a> by using your Rackspace account number, username, and password, you receive a 7-digit verification code via SMS to complete the two-factor authentication. Entering the incorrect 7-digit passcode causes authentication to fail. After six failed attempts, the account is locked. A user with administrator privileges is required to unlock the account. See the following section for instructions.</p>

<h3>Unlock a user account</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to unlock a user account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the <a href="https://myrackspace.com">MyRackspace portal</a> as an administrator.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Select <strong>Account &gt; User List</strong>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Locate the locked user and open the user’s account record.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, select <strong>Unlock User</strong>.
    <p>A green banner is displayed, stating that the user account was successfully unlocked.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Generate a temporary passcode</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to generate a temporary passcode for a user.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An account must be unlocked for this item to be displayed in the <strong>Actions</strong> menu.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the MyRackspace portal as an administrator.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Select <strong>Account &gt; User List</strong>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Locate the user and open the user’s account record.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, select <strong>Send Temporary Code</strong>.
    <p>A green banner is displayed, stating that the temporary code has been sent to the indicated device. The code is valid for five minutes.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Two-factor authentication links do not appear in the MyRackspace portal</h3>

<p>If you do not see the two-factor authentication links in the menu bar of the MyRackspace portal, the account might not be enabled for two-factor authentication, or the two-factor system might be unavailable because of maintenance or service interruption.</p>
