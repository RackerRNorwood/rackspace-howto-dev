Unfortunately Automatic Domain Renewal is not available for registered
Cloud Sites domains; the domains must be manually renewed via the
Control Panel. Please see the following article on how to manually renew
your domain:

Domain?](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-renew-my-domain-name-for-cloud-sites)
