<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to a feature that is no longer available for Cloud Sites. This article exists for legacy support only. Although we no longer offer free email service with Cloud Sites, you can connect to a mail service from your website by using PHPMail or another code library. You need a mail server to which you can connect; you can use our <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/" target="_blank" title="Rackspace Email service">Rackspace Email service</a>, <a href="http://www.mailgun.com" target="_blank" title="Mailgun">Mailgun</a>, or another third-party service that allows SMTP connections.</p>

<p>Several mail servers are available to you. The following table lists some of them:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although port 25 is listed for SMTP service, most ISPs block it by default because of exploitation of the service. Therefore, port 25 might not work for all customers.</p>
