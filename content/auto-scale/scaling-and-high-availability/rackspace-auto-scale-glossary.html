<h3>Agent</h3><p>A monitoring daemon that resides on the server being monitored. The agent gathers metrics based on agent checks and pushes them to Cloud Monitoring.</p><h3>Agent token</h3><p>An authentication token used to identify the agent when it communicates with Cloud Monitoring.</p><h3>Alarm</h3><p>A mechanism that contains a set of rules that determine when a notification is triggered.</p><h3>Authentication</h3><p>The act or process of confirming the identity of a user or the truth of a claim. The authentication service confirms that an incoming request is being made by the user who claims to be making the request. The service does this by validating a set of claims that the user makes. These claims are initially in the form of a set of credentials. After initial confirmation based on credentials, the authentication service issues a token to the user. When making subsequent requests, the user can provide the token as evidence that the user's identity has already been authenticated.</p><h3>Check</h3><p>A definition that explicitly specifies how you want to monitor an entity.</p><h3>Collector</h3><p>Software that collects data from the monitoring zone. The collector is mapped directly to an individual computer or a virtual machine.</p><h3>Convergence</h3><p>The act of Auto Scale adding or removing enough servers to satisfy the needed capacity.</p><h3>Convergence Delta</h3><p>The change in the number of servers that the system makes when a scaling policy is executed. For example, if the convergence delta is 2, then the system adds 2 servers. If it is -10, the system removes 10 servers.</p><h3>Cooldown</h3><p>See <strong><a href="#GroupCooldown" target="_self">Group cooldown</a></strong> and <a href="#PolicyCooldown" target="_self"><strong>Policy cooldown</strong></a>.</p><h3>Entity</h3><p>A resource that you want to monitor. Some examples are a server, a website, or a service.</p><h3>Flavor</h3><p>A resource configuration for a server. Each flavor is a unique combination of disk, memory, vCPUs, and network bandwidth.</p><h3><a name="GroupCooldown"></a>Group cooldown</h3><p>The length of time that must pass before a scaling group can be scaled up or down again. The purpose is to prevent events from triggering a policy execution before the requisite build time for creating servers in process because of a previous policy execution.</p><h3>Health monitor</h3><p>A configurable feature of each load balancer. A health monitor is used to determine whether a back-end node is usable for processing a request. The load balancing service currently supports active health monitoring.</p><h3><a name="Image"></a>Image</h3><p>A collection of files for a specific operating system (OS) that you use to create or rebuild a server. Rackspace provides prebuilt images. You can also create custom images from servers that you have launched. Custom images can be used for data backups or as "gold" images for additional servers.</p><h3>Launch configuration</h3><p>A configuration that contains the necessary details for adding and removing servers from a scaling group in the Rackspace Auto Scale API. The <strong>launchConfiguration</strong> object specifies whether you are creating a server or a load balancer and the necessary details about the configuration.</p><h3>Load balancer</h3><p>A logical device that belongs to a cloud account. A load balancer is used to distribute workloads between multiple back-end systems or services, based on the criteria that is defined as part of its configuration.</p><h3>Node</h3><p>A back-end device that provides a service on a specified IP and port.</p><h3>Notification</h3><p>An informational message that is sent to one or more addresses when an alarm is triggered.</p><h3><a name="PolicyCooldown"></a>Policy cooldown</h3><p>The length of time that must pass before a policy can be executed again. The purpose is to allow for a fast scale up and a slow scale downof servers.</p><h3>Scaling</h3><p>The process of adding or reducing capacity in response to changes in workload.</p><h3>Scaling group</h3><p>A set of identical servers and optionally a load balancer, that can scale up and down in response to load, as defined by the scaling policy and bound by the scaling group configuration.</p><h3>Scaling policy</h3><p>A policy that specifies how much capacity (that is, cloud servers) to add or reduce. A schedule-based scaling policy also specifies when this should happen. An event-based scaling policy relies on alerts that trigger webhooks.</p><h3>Session persistence</h3><p>A feature of the load balancing service that attempts to force subsequent connections to a service to be redirected to the same node as long as the node is online.</p><h3>Server</h3><p>A computer that provides explicit services to the client software running on its system. A server is a virtual machine (VM) instance in the Cloud Servers environment. To create a server, you must specify a name, flavor reference, and image reference.</p><h3>Server image</h3><p>See <a href="#Image" target="_self"><strong>Image</strong></a>.</p><h3>Virtual IP</h3><p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address that is configured on the load balancer. Clients use the virtual IP to connect to a service that is load balanced. Incoming connections are distributed to back-end nodes based on the configuration of the load balancer.</p><h3>Webhook</h3><p>A URL that can activate a specific (scale-up or scale-down) policy for a scaling group without requiring does this without authentication.</p>
