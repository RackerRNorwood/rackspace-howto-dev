<!-- start content --><p>If you're a VAT-registered business, in most cases you can reclaim the VAT you pay when you buy goods and services for your business. In order to reclaim this money you need to have records to support your claim. By collecting your VAT number, Rackspace can correctly prepare an invoice for your records. If you're not a VAT-registered business or organization then you cannot reclaim the VAT you pay when you purchase goods and services.</p><!-- Saved in parser cache with key cloudaccountswiki:pcache:idhash:42-0!1!0!!en!2!edit=0 and timestamp 20110324174342 --><div class="printfooter">&nbsp;</div><!-- end content -->
