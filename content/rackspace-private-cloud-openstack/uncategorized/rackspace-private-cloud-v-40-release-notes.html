<h3><a name="installing"></a>Installing Rackspace Private Cloud</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.0 is deployed through a series of bash scripts in the following stages:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Install Chef server on a node in the environment.</li>
	<li>Download the latest cookbooks to the Chef server.</li>
	<li>Install chef-client on each node that will be managed by Chef in your OpenStack cluster.</li>
	<li>Use Chef to create Controller nodes, Compute nodes, and more.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a detailed description of the prerequisites and process, refer to <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v4/rackspace-private-cloud-installation/content/rpc-getstarted-prereqs.html">Installation Prerequisites and Concepts</a> and the <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v4/rackspace-private-cloud-installation/content/rpc-common-front.html">Rackspace Private Cloud Installation Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The OpenCenter installer scripts are still available; however, OpenCenter only supports the Folsom release. An environment installed with OpenCenter can be upgraded to Grizzly, but the results have not been tested. For more information, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/upgrading-your-private-cloud">Upgrading Your Private Cloud</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="grizzly"></a>OpenStack Grizzly</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud Software now installs and supports the OpenStack Grizzly release. Existing Folsom environments installed with the Rackspace Private Cloud cookbooks can also be updated to Grizzly with the procedure documented in <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/upgrading-your-private-cloud">Upgrading Your Private Cloud</a>.</p>

<p>For detailed information about what is included in Grizzly, refer to the <a class="link" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Grizzly" target="_top">Grizzly release notes</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="quantum"></a>OpenStack Networking</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud Software now supports OpenStack Networking (Neutron, formerly Quantum). The Networking configuration provided by the Rackspace Private Cloud cookbooks allows you to choose between VLAN or GRE isolated networks, both provider- and tenant-specific. From the provider side, an administrator can also create a flat network. Concepts and configuration are described in <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-openstack-networking">Configuring OpenStack Networking</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, you cannot use Neutron routers, and the quantum-server service is not HA.</p>

<h3><a name="keystone-ldap-ad"></a>OpenStack Identity v2 with Active Directory and LDAP</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud Software now supports using Active Directory and LDAP as a backend for OpenStack Identity (Keystone). For instructions about configuring your environment for Active Directory and LDAP, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-active-directory-and-ldap-integration">Active Directory and LDAP Integration</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="cinder"></a>OpenStack Block Storage Third-Party Vendors</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud Software supports using OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder) with the following third-party storage vendors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>EMC</li>
	<li>NetApp</li>
	<li>Solidfire</li>
</ul>

<p>For instructions about configuring your environment for these vendors, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-openstack-block-storage">Configuring OpenStack Block Storage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="vmware-vmdk"></a>VMWare VMDK Conversion and Amazon AMI Image Import</h3>

<p>Rackspace has developed a tool to convert single-disk Linux VMDK images to OpenStack-compatible qcow2 images. The conversion is accomplished by means of a Python script available at <a class="link" href="https://github.com/rcbops/support-tools/tree/master/vmdk-conversion" target="_top"><code class="uri">https://github.com/rcbops/support-tools/tree/master/vmdk-conversion</code></a>. For instructions about using the tool, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-software-creating-an-instance-in-the-cloud#vmdk-image">Converting VMDK Linux Images</a>.</p>

<p>Multi-disk and Windows image conversions are not available at this time.</p>

<p>Amazon AMI images can also be imported into Glance. For instructions about importing AMI images, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-software-creating-an-instance-in-the-cloud#ami-image">Uploading AMI Images</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="glance-cloud-files"></a>Cloud Files with OpenStack Image Storage</h3>

<p>You can configure Rackspace Cloud Files as a backend for OpenStack Image Storage (Glance). For instructions about configuring your environment for Cloud Files, refer to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-openstack-image-storage">Configuring OpenStack Image Storage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ceilometer"></a>OpenStack Ceilometer</h3>

<p>The Rackspace Private Cloud installation includes OpenStack Ceilometer for the OpenStack cluster. In this installation, Ceilometer is only accessible through the API. For information about the Ceilometer API, refer to the <a class="link" href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/" target="_top">Ceilometer Developer Documentation</a>. Ceilometer is automatically included when you create your Controller and Compute nodes, and no additional configuration is required.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Ceilometer API cannot co-exist on a node with haproxy.</p>

<h2><a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues</h2>

<p>The following issues have been identified in Rackspace Private Cloud v. 4.0 and v 4.1.2.</p>

<h3>Updating Cookbooks with knife cookbook upload -a -o</h3>

<p>When updating to the v 4.0.0 cookbooks, Chef Server might fail to upload the cookbooks on the first attempt. If this happens, run <code>knife cookbook upload -a -o again</code>. This is related to <a href="http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4330">known Chef issue CHEF-4330</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">RHEL and CentOS Challenges With Advanced OpenStack Networking</h3>

<p>When using OpenStack Networking (Neutron), Controller nodes with Networking features and standalone Networking nodes require namespace kernel features that are not available in the default kernel shipped with RHEL 6.4, CentOS 6.4, and older versions of these operating systems. More information about Neutron limitations is available in the <a class="link" href="http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-network/admin/content/ch_limitations.html" target="_top">OpenStack documentation</a>, and more information about RedHat-derivative kernel limitations is provided in the <a class="link" href="http://openstack.redhat.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#For_which_distributions_does_RDO_provide_packages.3F" target="_top">RDO FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>If you require OpenStack Networking using these features, Rackspace recommends that you consider the RHEL and CentOS patches, or use Ubuntu 12.04 for the Controller and Networking nodes.</p>

<h3><a name="known-cinder-centOS"></a>Snapshot Deletion on CentOS</h3>

<p>Setting <strong>volume_clear</strong> in <code>cinder_conf</code> to <strong>shred</strong> or <strong>zero</strong> will cause snapshot deletion to fail in OpenStack Grizzly installations on CentOS. Rackspace recommends you set <strong>volume_clear</strong> to none until this issue is resolved in OpenStack.</p>

<h3>OpenStack Service Timeouts</h3>

<p>OpenStack service timeouts cannot be configured, which makes it possible for an OpenStack client to remain connected to a failed service for a longer period than is desirable. If you cannot wait for the connection to close, you can restart the service that is holding the connection. For example, if the nova compute service has failed, restart it with <strong>service nova-compute restart</strong> on Ubuntu or <strong>service openstack-nova-compute restart</strong> on CentOS.</p>
