<p><strong>APPLIES TO:</strong> RackConnect v3.0</p>

<p>RackConnect v3.0 is a hybrid offering that provides network connectivity between your dedicated and cloud environments. By default, you can manage your dedicated environment from within the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list">MyRackspace</a>&nbsp;portal but it does not allow you to manage any of your cloud environments. In order to perform some cloud account administration tasks from the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list">MyRackspace</a>&nbsp;portal, you must <em><strong>link</strong></em> your cloud accounts with your dedicated account. The linking of your dedicated account with your cloud accounts is how you inform us that your dedicated and cloud accounts belong to the same organization, and this then allows you to perform some cloud account administration functions from within the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list">MyRackspace</a>&nbsp;portal itself.</p>

<p>A RackConnect v3.0 <em><strong>configuration</strong></em> represents a single deployment of a RackConnect solution.&nbsp; A configuration is comprised of dedicated network devices that function in the RackConnect edge and connected network device roles, along with the stored settings needed to make these devices function with RackConnect. You may have multiple RackConnect configurations. A configuration is normally associated with one or more cloud accounts. Please view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-key-terms">RackConnect Key Terms</a> article for further details.</p>

<p>Once you have linked your cloud accounts with your dedicated account, you will then be able to <strong><em>associate</em></strong> your cloud accounts with your RackConnect v3.0 configurations from within the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list">MyRackspace</a>&nbsp;portal. Associating a cloud account with RackConnect v3.0 is how you inform us which of your linked cloud accounts should be associated with a particular RackConnect v3.0 configuration. Once you have associated a cloud account with one of your RackConnect v3.0 configurations, a ticket will automatically be generated for us, where we will work with you to fully configure the cloud account for use with RackConnect v3.0. Please view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-v30-requirements">RackConnect v3.0 Requirements</a> article for further details.</p>

Your linked cloud account's details will be displayed on the right-pane of the screen.</p>
