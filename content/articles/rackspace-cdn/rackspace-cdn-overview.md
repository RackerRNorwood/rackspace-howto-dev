Rackspace CDN [[product
page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cdn-content-delivery-network)] is a
content delivery network (CDN) service that you can use to CDN-enable
your website. It offers features such as pulling content from your
website&rsquo;s origin servers, rules for caching, access restrictions, and
purging content from the CDN&rsquo;s edge nodes.

Rackspace CDN is designed to improve the performance of publicly
distributed assets. Assets can be anything from website content, to web
application components, to media like videos, ads, and interactive
experiences.  CDNs decrease the load time of these assets by caching
them on edge nodes, which are also called edge servers or point of
presence (PoP) servers.  Edge nodes are distributed around the globe,
and they cache content and serve it directly to your customers, thus
reducing transit time to a customer's location. 

With simple provisioning via the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel or API,
Rackspace customers can CDN-enable their websites and applications in
seconds, no matter where the content is stored. They can also manage
their CDN-enabled domains and the origins and assets associated with
those domains. 

Rackspace CDN works with all Rackspace origins like Cloud Servers, Cloud
Load Balancers, Cloud Files, Dedicated servers, and any other resources
with a public interface.

The Rackspace CDN architecture includes the following components:

-   Use of the Akamai Technologies content delivery network, which is
    one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, with
    over 230 edge nodes around the world
-   The ability to cache publicly accessible resources hosted on a Cloud
    Servers instance, or in a public Cloud Files container
-   Cloud Control Panel integration
-   A RESTful API
-   A single global endpoint to access the API
