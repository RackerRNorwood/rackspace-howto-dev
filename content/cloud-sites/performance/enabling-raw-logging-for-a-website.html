<p>Raw logs are text files generated by your site that record information about site visitors and what URLs they accessed. &nbsp;They're in a standard referred to as "combined log format", designed to be read by log processors like web stats programs.</p>
<p>You can use the information in a raw log to help optimize your code to reduce strain on your site and improve response times. &nbsp;Raw logs can also be useful in some troubleshooting situations.</p>
<p>Raw logs files can take up a lot of space. If you are not using them &nbsp;you may want to disable them to free up space for your account.</p>
<p>Once enabled the raw logs can be found in your domain's FTP directory, in the "logs" folder. &nbsp;You can determine the path to the domain using <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_find_my_website%27s_Linux_path">this article on finding your web root</a>.</p>
