<p>Resellers can create domain aliases for their customers. If you are a direct customer, however, and you want to create a domain alias, please contact the Rackspace support team. Direct customers can still view the aliases that have been set by going to step 2 in the following procedure.</p>

<h2>Domain aliases and accepted domains</h2>

<p>You might want to create a domain alias if, for example, your company owns several domains (for example, <strong>mycompany.com</strong>, <strong>mycompany.biz</strong>, and <strong>mycompany.us</strong>), and you want to direct all incoming email to the company’s primary domain. If you assign <strong>mycompany.biz</strong> and <strong>mycompany.us</strong> as domain aliases, email that is sent to mailboxes at the aliases will be automatically redirected to a mailbox on the primary domain, <strong>mycompany.com</strong>.</p>

<p>The type of email hosting service that you use determines the relevant terminology ("domain alias" versus "accepted domain") and functionality (such as how email is redirected):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Domain alias—If you are a Rackspace Email customer, you will create a domain alias. Email sent to the domain alias is automatically directed to the corresponding mailbox in the original domain. For example, if <strong>mycompany.biz</strong> is a domain alias <strong>for mycompany.com</strong>, when someone sends an email to <strong>bob@mycompany.biz</strong> it is&nbsp; automatically redirected to <strong>bob@mycompany.com</strong>.</li>
	<li>Accepted domain—If you are a Microsoft Exchange customer, you create an accepted domain. Email sent to the accepted domain can be automatically directed to any mailbox that you specify. To specify which mailbox or mailboexes should receive email from an accepted domain’s email address, see the instructions in <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/support/portal/1560/1631/1873/1875/3945" target="_blank">Add an Address</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Add a domain alias or accepted domain</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://cp.rackspace.com/">Cloud Office control panel</a>.</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Go to section</strong> menu, select <strong>Domains</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Manage</strong> section, click <strong>Domain Aliases</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate domain name. Or, to change domains, click <strong>Change Domain</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Alias</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Alternate Domain</strong> box, enter the full domain name that you want to assign as a domain alias or accepted domain.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Alternate Domain Type</strong> area, select <strong>Domain Alias</strong> or <strong>Accepted Domain</strong>. To learn more, see the preceding section in this article.</li>
	<li>If you selected the Exchange option, <strong>Accepted Domain</strong>, select the <strong>Create alternate addresses for existing recipients</strong> check box to automatically generate the new domain addresses for your current Exchange mailboxes.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
