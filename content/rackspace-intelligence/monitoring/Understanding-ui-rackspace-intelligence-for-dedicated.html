<p>Rackspace Intelligence monitors the availability of your IT infrastructure and, when limits are exceeded, can respond by notifying someone.</p>

<p>When you&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-into-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts">log in to Rackspace Intelligence</a><a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-into-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts">,</a> you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="524" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Dashboard.png" width="896" /></p>

<p>The dashboard provides a main overview of all of your monitoring activities.</p>

<p>You can also examine different aspects of how Rackspace Intelligence is configured to monitor your system by accessing the following sections from the header:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monitor</li>
	<li>Notify</li>
	<li>Visualize</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the offerings in that section. For example, in the Monitor&nbsp;section, you can choose to work with entities or open alerts.</p>

<p>Customers with dedicated accounts can utilize the Rackspace Intelligence to view information about the following items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Entities monitored by Rackspace Intelligence</li>
	<li>Open alerts</li>
	<li>Checks</li>
	<li>Notifications</li>
	<li>Notification plans</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to <a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/viewing-and-creating-graphs-of-activity-in-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts">view and generate graphs to visualize infrastructure availability</a>.</p>
