Python-novaclient is a command-line client for controlling OpenStack
instances.  Since the next generation of Cloud Servers is based on
OpenStack, python-novaclient will work with Cloud Servers as well. The
client provides a bit more functionality than the control panel without
needing to delve into the API directly.

We have installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux:
