<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking your username in the upper-right corner of the control panel and selecting Cloud Sites Control Panel.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Before scheduling a task, take a minute to review the five necessary components in creating a scheduled task on Cloud Sites:</strong></p>
<p>1. Task Name – You will need to name each cron job you schedule. The name you choose is completely up to you and does not have any specific requirements.</p>
<p>2. Email Address for Output - You will need a valid email address so you can receive notice once the job has completed. You may have to tune your spam filter settings to receive the desired status emails.</p>
<p>3. Command Language - What language is the script to be executed written in? The Rackspace Cloud supports the scheduling of scripts which execute in the following environments:</p>
<pre>* PHP
* Python
* Perl
* HTTP
</pre>
<p>Items to note about the scripting language options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Perl" option can also be used to execute shell scripts.</li>
<li>The "HTTP" option causes a visit to the URL you provide (technically running "curl &lt;URL&gt;" for the cron task). &nbsp;The output is sent to the task log in your webroot's "logs" directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Command to Run – You’ll need to indicate the path to the script that you wish to be execute.</p>
<p>5. Frequency / Date / Time - How frequently do you want the task to run? Everyday? Once a week? Once a week on a certain day of the week? Once a month? Once a month on a certain day of the month? What time of day do you want the specified task to run? All of these variations are possible through the Classic Cloud Control Panel.</p>
<p><br /> Here’s an example of setting up a new scheduled task in the Cloud Sites Control Panel.</p>
<p><br /> 1. Log into the Cloud Sites Control Panel at <a class="external free" title="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com" href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com" rel="nofollow">https://manage.rackspacecloud.com</a>.</p>
<p>2. Click on "Hosting" on the left navigation menu and then click on "Cloud Sites".</p>
<p>3. Click on the site to which you want to add a cron backup.</p>
<p>4. Click on the "Features" tab on the top navigation bar.</p>
<p>5. Scroll down to the section called “Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs).” This is where you will see all tasks that you have scheduled and their status for that particular domain.</p>
<p>6. Add a new task by clicking the “Add New Task” button. (NOTE: All newly created cron jobs are enabled by default.)</p>
<p>7. Enter a task name. For this example, let’s call our task as “Wake Me Up.”</p>
<p>8. Enter the email address where you want the output from your task to be sent. For this illustration, we’ll enter sleepyuser@myhome.com.</p>
<p>9. The script that was chosen is written in Perl. So we’ll choose Perl as the command language.</p>
<p>10. Under the Command to Run option, it’s important to note that the top-level fully qualified path will be appended to the script path. Now the fully qualified path to our script is:</p>
<pre>/mnt/Target01/123456/www.wakeupcall.com/scripts/wakemeup.pl</pre>
<p>In this case, we would only have to enter “scripts/wakemeup.pl” in the field. “/mnt/Target01/123456/www.wakeupcall.com/” will automatically be appended. Please also note that the trailing slash is automatically added.</p>
<p><br /> 11. The next section involves scheduling the time when the job needs to be run. In our case, we want the script to run every day at 7:00AM. So we would change the selection under “Repeat by the: __” drop down menu to “Day.” In the “Time” field, we would enter “7:00.”</p>
<p>12. Click the “Add Task” button at the bottom and the cron job will be enabled.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>NOTE</strong>: When you add a website through the Cloud Sites Control Panel, a log directory is also created as a part of the website directory structure. In order for the cron tool to run properly, this directory structure must be preserved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions on scheduling a task, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>
