Organization
------------

Several features help you organize, find, and efficiently manage your
resources no matter the size or shape of your cloud inventory.

### Tags

Tags let you add customized labels to any of the resources that make up
your cloud infrastructure. You are in charge of your tags--create as
many as you'd like and assign them as needed. For example, you could
distinguish your servers by their functional role, a certain website
association, a specific technology, or even by geographical location.

### Filters

Filters help you find all resources that share the following common
properties: Tag, Status, Image, RAM, Region, or Type. The list of your
filters is located at the left side of the control panel. When you
create and tag resources, the list is automatically populated. When you
select a check box next to a filter, the list of resources shows only
the matching ones.

An example of what the filters might look like for Cloud Servers:

Tags are included in the list of filters, which gives you a powerful yet
simple way to find only the specific resources that you want to work
with. For example, you could filter your list of servers to show all 2
GB servers that you've tagged as **Production**. Using the Status
filter, you can drill down even further and find the servers that are
currently running, offline, or have a different status. 

### Search

A convenient and fast search field in the upper-right corner of each
asset listing gives you another method for locating any asset. Simply
enter part of the asset name, tag, or IP address in the search field.

When you use tags, filters, and search, your cloud inventory can grow to
any size and you'll still be able to promptly locate and manage any
asset.

Administrative actions
----------------------

The control panel provides a variety of ways to perform administrative
tasks. Whether you're looking at a list of assets or a detailed view of
a single asset, you don't need to leave your current location to perform
a task--every task you might want to perform is accessible right where
you are.

### Actions gear

When viewing resources in a list, click the gear icon to the left of the
resource name to access a drop-down menu with all available actions for
that resource. The actions gear is always part of every list, whether
it's a list of servers, files, or load balancers. The following image
shows the actions gear drop-down menu for a cloud server named
1TestVyatta:

### Actions menu

If you're looking at the details of a specific resource, you'll find the
**Actions **drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.

### Edit pencils and options

You can also edit an existing setting for a resource by clicking the
edit pencil or option that appears next to the resource description. For
example, you could rebuild the image or add a record by clicking the
option that appears after the description for each setting.

### Popup boxes

When you perform an administrative action on a resource, a popup dialog
box lets you modify the settings or perform an action without taking you
to another page. You can modify a resource much faster because you don't
have to wait for the page to reload.
