<p>Rackspace Cloud Files is storage service that enables users to store an unlimited number of files and to publish and distribute content behind a content delivery network (CDN). Following are some differences between Rackspace CDN and Cloud Files:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Users of Rackspace CDN specify the origins that host the content, and the CDN pulls the content from these origins. Origins can be dedicated servers, cloud servers, cloud load balancers, or even servers hosted outside of Rackspace. Users of Cloud Files can CDN-enable a container, thereby distributing the contents of that container to the CDNâ€™s edge nodes. In Rackspace CDN, it is not yet possible to specify a Cloud Files container as an origin.</li>
	<li>Rackspace CDN has no limit on purges. Cloud Files limits the number of purges per account, per day to 25.</li>
	<li>Rackspace CDN does not yet support streaming video from Cloud Files CDN-enabled containers or serving CDN-enabled content over SSL/TLS. Cloud Files supports streaming video from CDN-enabled containers as well as serving CDN-enabled content over SSL/TLS.</li>
</ul>

<p>These, and other differences, are summarized in the following table:</p>
