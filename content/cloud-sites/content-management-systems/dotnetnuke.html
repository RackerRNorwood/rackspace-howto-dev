Select your installation method and language type and click on the "Next" button.

Enter the hostname for your database for the "Server" field. Enter your database name in the "Database" field. Make sure to uncheck the box for "Integrated Security." Enter your database username and password into the appropriate fields.</li><li>Enter an Object Qualifier, like 'dnn' for example.</li><li>Click on the "Next" button and DNN will begin creating the database.

Enter the appropriate properties and click on the "Next" button to complete the installation.</li></ol><p>You have now completed the DNN installation. You may continue, using the "Finished (Go to Site)" button, or go back to a previous step using "Previous."</p><p>Note: In the event that you get an "undefined success" error message as part of the database installation procedure, you can use the following suggestions:</p><ul><li>Allow the installer to continue to scroll through the error messages for several minutes to ensure that all of the database tables have been added.</li><li>Use your back button to return to the beginning of the installation and select "Automatic" installation. Because the database tables already exist, the installer will skip this step and complete successfully.</li><li>If all other attempts fail to correct error, you can wipe out your database and start again fresh to ensure no data was added.
