<h3>What Happens to Old Images?</h3>

<p>In order to provide the best experience possible for our customers we carefully maintain the list of images displayed when building a new cloud server. This means that from time to time older versions of an operating system may be removed from the default list, usually shortly after a newer version is released. In general, we try to keep the most current and at least one previous release of each operating system we support.</p>

<p>Images that have been publicly released are never actually deleted, so you can still access these older images by referencing the image ID directly through the Cloud Servers API.&nbsp; If youâ€™re looking for an older version of your favorite Linux distro you can probably locate it in the list below. Please be aware that these older images are no longer maintained and may not contain the most up-to-date patches and package updates.</p>
