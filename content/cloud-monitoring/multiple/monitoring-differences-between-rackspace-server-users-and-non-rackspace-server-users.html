<p>Rackspace Cloud Monitoring can be used on Rackspace servers and non-Rackspace servers. When using a Rackspace server, you can be a managed or an unmanaged user. There are some differences between what you can do in any one of these circumstances. This page describes those differences.</p>

<p>Please Note: The <strong>Rackspace Managed </strong><strong style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Infrastructure</strong><strong>&nbsp;Servers</strong>&nbsp;column (in the middle) overlaps at times with both the <strong><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Rackspace&nbsp;</span>Managed </strong><strong>Operations Servers</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Unmanaged&nbsp;Non-Rackspace Servers</strong> as the table indicates. There are no managed non-Rackspace servers.</p>

<table border="1">

			<p>The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server. This value is stored as <strong>monitoring_token</strong> in the agent configuration file.</p>

			<p>In addition, the agent needs to know which entity it is installed on. This value is the <strong>agent_id</strong> associated with the entity on the monitoring server. This is also a field in the agent configuration file</p>

			<p>If you are going to create an image out of a non-Rackspace server to be used to spin up more servers, you need to remove the <strong>agent_id</strong> field (<em>before you generate the image</em>) in the agent configuration file that is generated when you run agent setup. Otherwise, the agent will be associated with the same entity that the image was created from and the checks won't work properly.</p>

				<li>Ubuntu, CentOS: /etc/rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg</li>
				<li>Windows: c:\ProgramData\Rackspace Monitoring\config\rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg</li>
