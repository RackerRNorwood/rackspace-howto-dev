<p>To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a&nbsp;<a href="https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud">Rackspace Cloud account</a>&nbsp;and you must be logged in to the&nbsp;<a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>&nbsp;for that account. Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.</p>

<h2>To access Rackspace Intelligence</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the&nbsp;Rackspace Intelligence user interface at&nbsp;<a href="https://intelligence.rackspace.com/">https://intelligence.rackspace.com</a>.<br />
	If you're not already logged in, you are redirected to the Cloud Control Panel login page at <u>https://mycloud.rackspace.com</u>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At the Cloud Control Panel login page, log in as usual. If your account is configured to require it, you might need to perform additional steps to&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel#login2Factor">log in with multi-factor authentication</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>While you are logged in, the Rackspace Intelligence user interface can display information about some of the same entities that you can see in the Cloud Control Panel. For example, if you use the Cloud Control Panel to create a cloud server, you can then use the Rackspace Intelligence interface to visualize the status of that server.</p>

<p>The Cloud Control Panel lists your cloud servers.</p>
