<p>This article provides information about how to use Rackspace CDN with Rackspace Cloud Sites.</p>

<p>To get your website set up with Rackspace CDN, you need to create a Rackspace CDN service and then change the DNS for your site. You can use the DNS management tool in the Cloud Sites Control Panel to create, modify, and delete DNS records. For more information about the DNS management tool in Cloud Sites, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-managing-dns-records">Getting Started with Cloud Sites - Managing DNS records</a>.</p>

<p>To create a CDN service to use with your webiste, you need to know the IP address of your site (your origin) and and the <strong>www</strong> address of your site (your domain). For complete instructions for creating a CDN service, see <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/create-a-cdn-service-with-rackspace-cdn">Create a CDN service with Rackspace CDN</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="478" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-16%20at%204.14.51%20PM.png" width="637" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Click <strong>Create Service</strong>.</p>

<p>After the service is created, the service details page is displayed.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp; In the Service Details section, hover over the <strong>Domain Name</strong> value and copy the <strong>CDN Domain</strong> URL that is displayed in the pop-up menu. You need this URL in the next section, to update your DNS records.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="Update DNS" name="Update DNS"></a>Update DNS</h2>

<p>After you have created your Rackspace CDN service, use the Cloud Sites DNS management tool to update the DNS for your <strong>www</strong> domain by performing the following steps.</p>

<p>1. In the Cloud Sites Control Panel, click the <strong>DNS</strong> tab for your site.</p>

<p>2. Delete the existing A record by selecting it, clicking on <strong>Delete Selected</strong>, and confirming the deletion.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="252" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-17%20at%202.31.45%20PM.png" width="655" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. In the DNS Management section, click <strong>Add Record</strong>.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Create a new CNAME record. For <strong>Record Name</strong>, enter <strong>www</strong> domain. For Content, enter the CDN domain URL that you copied at the end of "Create a CDN service."</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="391" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-16%20at%204.37.58%20PM.png" width="666" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>After you have updated the CNAME and verified that the change has been propagated, you can then access any files stored within the origin via the specified domain name. In the example for this article, anything stored on <strong>www.brandedexample.com</strong> is now available via the CDN.</p>

<h2><strong><span><a id="Create caching rules" name="Create caching rules"></a>Create caching rules</span></strong></h2>

<p>Caching rules determine how long your content lives on the edge servers (or nodes) before checking the origin server for an update. If your content changes frequently, then set up a time to live (TTL) rule that pulls content from the origin server every few minutes. If your content does not change frequently, then set a longer TTL of 12â€“24 hours. If you create multiple caching rules, order them from the least specific to the most specific.</p>

<p>The best content to cache is static files such as images, videos, CSS, and JavaScript. Most sites are well organized and keep that content together, which makes it easier to choose what to cache. If you are not sure, contact your developer or post your question at the <a href="https://community.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Community</a> forum.</p>
