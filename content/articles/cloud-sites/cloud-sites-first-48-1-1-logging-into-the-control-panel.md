### Hello and welcome to the Rackspace Cloud!

Now that your account has been activated, the first thing that you'll
want to do is to log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control
Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/) to access your account.

-   Just open a browser to:
     [http://manage.rackspacecloud.com](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/)

![](http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/login2.png)

-   Log in with the username & password that you selected when you
    created the account.  Those credentials are only for accessing the
    Control Panel. 

The Control Panel has 3 main sections

1.  **The Left Navigation menu** (green box)
2.  **Details Section** (blue box)
3.  **Cloud News** (purple box)

Left Navigation Menu
--------------------

Your "Go To" menu, where you access all your assets, support, and manage
account information.

Details Section
---------------

This dynamic section displays the specific data associated with your
selections from the left navigation menu. 

Cloud News
----------

This dynamic section viewable from the Home Screen will show the latest
news including new features releases, pricing updates, industry news,
and strategic initiatives. This is NOT the place to see maintenance
announcements.  Any news of service impacting events will still be
reported from the [Cloud
Status](http://status.rackspacecloud.com/) page.

Left Navigation Menu
--------------------

-   **Home** - Takes you to the Welcome page with Account Activity
    Summary displayed.

Click on the tab labeled 'Getting Started' from the Welcome screen.
 This will show you a brief overview of some key concepts for our
products, and is a handy 'quick-reference' guide.

    Guides, Cloud Status, Knowledge Center, Problem Ticketing System,
    and Live Chat.  All these resources are also available from links at
    the top of the page.
