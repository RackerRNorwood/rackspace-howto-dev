    <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

    <p>Cloud Files™ is an affordable, redundant, scalable, and dynamic storage
    service offering. The core storage system is designed to provide a safe,
    secure, automatically re-sizing and network accessible way to store
    data.</p>

    <p>You can store an unlimited quantity of files ranging in size from a few
    bytes to extremely large. Users can store as much as they want and pay only
    for storage space they actually use.</p>

    <p>Cloud Files makes it easy to serve content through a CDN. This allows
    users to take advantage of a proven world-class content distribution
    network that is affordable and easy to use.</p>

    <p>Cloud Files also allows users to store/retrieve files and CDN-enable
    content with a simple Web Service (ReST: Representational State Transfer)
    interface. There are also language-specific API’s that utilize the ReST API
    but make it much easier for developers to integrate into their
    applications.</p>

    <h4 id="idealusesforcloudfiles">Ideal uses for Cloud Files</h4>

    <p>There are a number of uses for the Cloud Files service. Cloud Files is
    an excellent storage solution for a number of scenarios and is well suited
    for a number of applications such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Backing up or archiving data</li>

        <li>Serving images/videos (streaming data to the user’s browser)</li>

        <li>Serving content with a world-class CDN (Akamai)</li>

        <li>Storing secondary/tertiary, static web-accessible data</li>

        <li>Developing new applications with data storage integration</li>

        <li>Storing data when predicting storage capacity is difficult</li>

        <li>Storing data for applications affordably</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="keyconcepts">Key Concepts</h4>

    <p>Cloud Files™ is not a “file system” in the traditional sense. You will
    not be able to map or mount virtual disk drives like you can with other
    forms of storage such as a SAN or NAS. Since Cloud Files is a different way
    of thinking when it comes to storage, please take a few moments
    to&nbsp;<a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/Key_Concepts">review the
    concepts</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="usingcloudfiles">Using Cloud Files</h4>

    <p>There are two ways to use Cloud Files:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>GUI interface such as the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel or Cyberduck.
        </li>

        <li>Programming interfaces via ReST, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, or
        C#/.NET.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Control Panel Interface</h4>

    <p>The Control Panel provides an browser based, intuitive, easy to use
    graphical user interface. The interface allows you to manage your
    Containers and Objects without any programming knowledge. From there, users
    can CDN-enable the Container by marking it “public”. Any Objects stored in
    a public, CDN-enabled Container are directly accessible over the Akamai’s
    CDN.</p>

    <h4 id="programminginterfaces">Programming Interfaces</h4>

    <p>There are several programming interfaces for Cloud Files that will allow
    you to integrate the storage solution into your applications, or provide
    automated ways of accessing the system. Currently, we support a ReST
    web-services API and several programming language API’s (Python, PHP, Java,
    Ruby, and C#/.NET).</p>

    <p>Please refer to the Developer Guide for more details about using these
    interfaces. You can access the Developer Guide on our&nbsp;<a href=
    "http://docs.rackspace.com/api/">API documentation site</a>.</p>
