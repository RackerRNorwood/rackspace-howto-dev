<p>This article describes the use of the Time To Live (TTL) attribute and how it works.</p>

<p>When you create a container in Cloud Files and you make that container public, the files within that container have a designated TTL. The TTL is the time interval after which the CDN will reread the contents of the container. This attribute and its value can be modified in the CDN through the Cloud Files user interface.</p>

<p>New values take effect after the current TTL cycle is completed. The TTL can be any value between 15 minutes and 50 years. Use higher numbers for static content that doesn't change often, and use smaller numbers for content that changes more often. If you require a longer TTL, see the following blog post about using the API to set TTL: Extending TTL for Cloud Files CDN Users.</p>

<p>Use the following steps to modify a containerâ€™s TTL within the Cloud Control Panel:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the top navigation bar, select <strong>Storage &gt; Files</strong>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If the container is not already public, click the gear icon next to the container and select <strong>Make Public (Enable CDN)</strong>. In the popup box, click <strong>Publish to CDN</strong>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click the gear icon next to the container again and select <strong>Modify Time To Live (TTL)</strong>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enter the TTL for the container in seconds, and then click <strong>Save TTL</strong>.</li>
</ol>
