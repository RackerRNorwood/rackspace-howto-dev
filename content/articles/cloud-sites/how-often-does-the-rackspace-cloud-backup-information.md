Cloud Sites creates backups of your data on a nightly basis. However,
its purpose is for disaster recovery on the server side. If for any
reason a storage node on our side were to crash, our backups will be
there to replace any lost data.\
  

With that said, we recommend that you make periodic backups of you site
and data to your local computer. If you need a backup of your MySQL or
MS SQL databases, they can be exported through our online utilities or
by connecting directly to the servers using desktop software.
