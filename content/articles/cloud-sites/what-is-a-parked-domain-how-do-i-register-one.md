If you want to purchase a domain but are not ready to use it for a
website, you can "park" the domain. A parked domain is a domain that is
registered but doesn't point to a website -- although you always have
the option to point the domain to a website at a later date.

To register a parked domain with Cloud Sites:

1.  Log in to your Cloud Sites Control Panel at
    [http://manage.rackspacecloud.com](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com "http://manage.rackspacecloud.com").
2.  In the control panel, click the "Hosting" link in the left
    navigation bar. Then select "Cloud Sites". Then select "Add a New
    Website".
3.  Under "Add a New Website," select the Site Owner from the pull-down
    menu and enter the Domain Name in the next box.
4.  Select the term length for the purchase of the domain.
5.  Under "Other Options" select the "Domain Registration Only (park
    domain)" option and click "Next."

You should then receive confirmation that Cloud Sites has added your
website to your account.
