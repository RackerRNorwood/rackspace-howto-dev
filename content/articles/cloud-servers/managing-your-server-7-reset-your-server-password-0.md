An extremely important aspect of managing your server is controlling the
(Linux) **root** or (Windows) **Administrator** account password.  You
can always reset it through the [Cloud Control
Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com).  

**Note:**  Changing the server password may also initiate a system
reboot.  Make sure all your configuration changes on your machine have
been saved before resetting your password, or they will not take effect.

-   First Generation Linux servers will reboot after a password change.
-   Next Generation servers do not require or initiate a reboot after a
    password change.

**Step 1**: Log in to the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

**Step 2**: Click the gear icon next to the server for which you want to
change the password.

**Step 3**: Under "Manage," click **Change Password**.

After you enter the new password, your server will reboot and the new
password will be set.
