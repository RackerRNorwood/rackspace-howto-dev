undefined&rsquo;t need to worry about running out of online
    storage space. Because emails are downloaded to your computer, you
    can keep as many emails as your computer can store.

-   **Backup:** You should implement an effective backup system for your
    computer, in case you need to retrieve lost or deleted emails.

-   **Internet connection:** You must have an Internet connection to
    download your email, but you can view your downloaded email offline
    (that is, without an Internet connection).

Mobile Sync
-----------

When you check your email using Mobile Sync, you are accessing and
managing your email directly from the email server using Microsoft
ActiveSync technology. Following are some features of Mobile Sync:

-   **Access**: Because emails are stored on the email server, you can
    access and manage your email and email folders from multiple
    computers or mobile devices.\
      
-   **New Items:** Mobile Sync utilizes "push" technology. When a new
    email arrives, the email is pushed to your device instantly.\
      
-   **Storage**: If you have limited online storage space, you might
    need to delete some emails periodically to avoid exceeding your
    storage capacity.\
      
-   **Backup**: Email is automatically backed up every evening. If you
    accidentally delete an email, your email administrator can retrieve
    it, even up to 14 days later.\
      
-   **Internet** **Connection**: You must have an internet connection to
    access your email. 

**Note**: This service is an additional fee and enabled by your email
administrator. For more information,
