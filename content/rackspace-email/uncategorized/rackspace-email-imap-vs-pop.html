<p>If you are using Rackspace Email and are setting up your email software (for example, Microsoft Outlook or&nbsp;Mac Mail), you must indicate whether you want to receive email by using an IMAP or POP connection.&nbsp;IMAP is generally the preferred method because&nbsp;it gives you complete access to all email and all email folders, from multiple computers or mobile devices. This article describes the differences between the IMAP and&nbsp;POP mail protocols.</p>

<p>For Rackspace Email settings for both IMAP and POP, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/4214">Rackspace Email and Hosted Exchange settings</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We strongly recommend using an IMAP connection&nbsp;with Rackspace Email.</li>
	<li>Microsoft Exchange users normally access their mailbox data via the Exchange server&nbsp;rather than using a POP or IMAP connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IMAP</h2>

<p>When you check your email with an IMAP connection, you are accessing and managing your email directly from the email server. Following are some&nbsp;features of IMAP:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Access:</strong> Because&nbsp;emails are stored on the email server, you can access and manage your email and email folders from multiple computers or mobile devices.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;If you have limited online storage space, you might need to delete some emails periodically to avoid exceeding your storage capacity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Backup:</strong>&nbsp;Email is automatically backed up every evening. If you accidentally delete an email, your email administrator can retrieve it, even up to 14 days later.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Internet connection:</strong>&nbsp;You must&nbsp;have an Internet connection to&nbsp;access your email.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, email clients store your sent, draft, and trash email on your computer, rather than storing it on the email server (as it should with an IMAP connection). You might&nbsp;need to map your email folders within your email client.</p>

<h2>POP</h2>

<p>When you check your email with a POP connection, new email messages are downloaded to your computer and are then deleted from the email server.&nbsp;Following are some&nbsp;features of POP:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Access:</strong> Because your email is stored on your computer, you must be at your computer to access your email.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Storage:</strong> You donâ€™t need to worry about running out of online storage space. Because&nbsp;emails are downloaded to your computer, you can keep as many emails as your computer can store.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Backup:</strong> You should implement an effective backup system for your computer, in case you need to retrieve lost or deleted emails.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Internet connection:</strong> You must have&nbsp;an Internet connection to download your email, but you can view your downloaded email offline (that is, without an Internet connection).</p>
	</li>
</ul>
