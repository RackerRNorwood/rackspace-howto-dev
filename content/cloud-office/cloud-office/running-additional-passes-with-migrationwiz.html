<p>When you are migrating email to Rackspace, all email might not be migrated over to the new Rackspace mailboxes after the first migration pass. &nbsp;This incomplete migration usually occurs during the Switch Over phase when changing MX records.&nbsp; During that time, email might continue to be delivered to the environment from which you are migrating.&nbsp; To mitigate this issue, you can run additional migration passes. &nbsp;These extra passes capture differential data and migrate any new items that might not have been available during the first migration. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>How Many Additional Passes Can Be Run?</h3>

<p>Every mailbox being migrated receives up to 10 passes at no additional charge. Following are some additional details about migrations passes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>MigrationWiz does not duplicate items that have been migrated by the service itself. No matter how many times you submit a migration, you should not encounter duplicates.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>MigrationWiz does not delete items during delta migration passes. For example, an email which was migrated during a first migration pass and later deleted at the source, that email is not deleted from the destination Rackspace mailbox during additional passes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>MigrationWiz does not update items during additional migration passes; it only migrates items that were not migrated during a previous migration. For example, if an email was migrated during a first migration pass and was later modified at the source, that email is not updated in the destination Rackspace mailbox during an additional migration pass.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you move emails to different source sub-folders during a migration, those emails might appear in a second folder after an additional pass. For example, suppose that emails in source folder A were migrated, but later those emails were moved to source folder B. MigrationWiz remembers which emails it migrated from folder A. However, because items have been moved to a new source folder B, MigrationWiz migrates these emails to folder B in the destination Rackspace mailbox. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Run Additional Passes When Migrating via MigrationWiz:</h3>

<p>1. Log in to the migration portal via the link that was sent to you when you signed up for MigrationWiz.&nbsp;<br />
The link looks similar to the following one: https://rackspace.selfmigration.com/Public/Default.aspx?t=MjEyMTRiMGYtOW...<br />
After you log in, you are directed to the page that you were previously on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. To view all migration projects, click the <strong>My migrations</strong> link in the upper-right corner of the page.</p>

<p>3. In the <strong>Actions</strong> column of the <strong>Migrations Projects</strong> table, click the <strong>Migrate New Items</strong> icon . &nbsp;The <strong>Status</strong> will then change to Processing, indicating that the pass has begun. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
