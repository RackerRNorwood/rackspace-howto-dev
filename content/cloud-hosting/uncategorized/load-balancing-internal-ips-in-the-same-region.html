<h2>Public and Internal IPs</h2>

<p>All Next Generation Cloud Servers automatically receive three IP addresses upon creation:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>A version 4 <strong>IP Address</strong></span>&nbsp;that provides public access to your server from anywhere on the Internet.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A version 6 <strong>IP Address</strong>&nbsp;that also provides public access to your from anywhere on the Internet.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An internal&nbsp;<strong>Rackspace Network</strong>&nbsp;(ServiceNet) IP address that you lets you access the server from other Cloud Servers or Cloud Load Balancers over the internal Rackspace Network.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong>Server Details</strong> section in the <a href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a> for a server name Zippy:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: First Generation&nbsp;Cloud Servers receive only 2 IP addresses: a public v4 IP address and the internal Rackspace Network IP address. In the Cloud Control Panel, the Rackspace Network is called ServiceNet.</p>

<h2>Why is this Important to Load Balancing?</h2>

<p>If your Cloud Server (also known as a <strong>node </strong>within the&nbsp;Cloud Load Balancers product)&nbsp;and Cloud Load Balancer are set up in the <em>same region</em>, they can send traffic over the Rackspace Network without traversing the Internet, and therefore incur zero bandwidth charges. This not only saves you money, but speeds up performance of the load balancer. However, if the node is in the Chicago region and your Load Balancer is set up in Dallas, traffic cannot go across the Rackspace Network only. It must traverse the internet, which incurs normal bandwidth charges that will appear on your monthly invoice.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates this concept. The traffic between the nodes and load balancer in the Dallas region incur zero bandwidth charges, while the traffic between the node in Chicago and the load balancer in Dallas will incur normal bandwidth charges:</p>

<h2><strong>Selecting a Load Balancer's Region</strong></h2>

<p>To take advantage of this cost savings and performance feature, you'll need to match the location of your Cloud Load Balancer with the node. The following screenshot shows you Configuration area of the Create Load Balancer page in the Cloud Control Panel. This is where you select the <strong>Region</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you're load balancing an external node (one that is external to the Rackspace Cloud), choose the region that is geographically closest to the external node.</p>
