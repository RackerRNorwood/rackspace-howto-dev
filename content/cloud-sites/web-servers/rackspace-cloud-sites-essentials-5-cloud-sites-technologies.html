<p><strong>Note</strong>: This article is written for our <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_self">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can get to it from the Cloud Control Panel by clicking your name in the upper-right corner and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;or by navigating to <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">manage.rackspacecloud.com</a>.</p>

<p>By now, we've learned that Cloud Sites is and easy to use, load-and-go web hosting platform that uses the computing power of the cloud to keep your websites online. In this article, we're going to take a look at the different technologies behind this computing power running your website(s).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Run Linux or Windows</strong></p>

<p>Behind Cloud Sites, cabinets full of both Linux servers and Windows servers power the over 100,000 sites and applications we host for our customers. Every Windows-based page is served from clusters built and optmiized especially for Windows, and every Linux-based page is served from clusters built and optimized especially for Linux. We use advanced Load-Balancing technologies to automatically detect the type of technology you are running and route each request to the proper pool of servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a great example of the power of cloud computing, since you no longer have to make a hosting choice between Linux and Windows. Both LAMP and .NET are included, allowing you to choose the technology you need site by site.</p>

<p>Let's take a look in the <a href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a> to see where you can specify which technology you would like your website(s) to operate with and how to change this technology.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Once you've logged into the Cloud Sites Control Panel, navigate to <strong>Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="246" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/hosting.png" width="187" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Click on the domain name you would like to make technology changes to</li>
	<li>Click on the Features Tab</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="107" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/featurestab.png" width="497" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Click on the <strong>Change Technology</strong>&nbsp;button in the <strong>Technologies</strong> section</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="179" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/technologies_1.png" width="600" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the <strong>Site Technology</strong> you would like your website to use</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="158" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/change-technology_1.png" width="600" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Click <strong>Change Technology</strong> to complete your change</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong><em>Please note that when changing your site's default technology, this changes the IP for the site. If we are managing your DNS, the changes will update automatically, but can take up to two hours to take effect. If you are managing your own DNS, please update the IP for you site. You can get the new IP on the Domain Tab</em></p>

<p><strong>There is a great method in the Control Panel</strong> to take a look at the current Website features for your website. You can get to this once you have logged in to the Cloud Sites Cloud Control Panel fairly quickly for each of your domains.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="246" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/hosting.png" width="187" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Click on the <strong>domain name</strong> for which you would like to review its website features</li>
	<li>Once it opens, you will be on &nbsp;the <strong>General Settings tab </strong>by default</li>
	<li>Scroll down to <strong>Website Features</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="181" src="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/web_features.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>What you have here is a breakdown of your website's current features including its currently enabled technologies, its number of databases&nbsp;and whether the Raw Logs are enabled or disabled. (Raw Logs are disabled by default).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This concludes this article regarding Cloud Sites Web Technologies. We've learned how to change your websites default technology and how to view a summary of your websites features quickly. The next article will discuss two of the most commonly talked about features on the Rackspace Cloud Sites, managing your website through .htaccess (Linux) and/or web.config (IIS, ASP/.NET).&nbsp;</p>
