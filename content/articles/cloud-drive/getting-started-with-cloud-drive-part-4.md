### Prerequisites

[Setting Up Cloud Drive: Enabling Your Master
Account](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-cloud-drive-enabling-your-master-account)

***Note:** We no longer accept new sign-ups for Cloud Drive, though it
is still supported for existing customers. New customers should use the
[equivalent service offered via JungleDisk](https://jungledisk.com/)
instead.*

Configuring Disk(s) Access allows administrators to set certain
permissions to an online disk. This can be beneficial for users who just
need to Read data from an online disk. Let's take a look at the steps
below on how to set this up:

### Configuring Disk(s) Access:

1. First thing will do is login into your cloud drive control panel
(e.g, http://example.myjungledisk.com). Once you're logged in, select
the **Sub-Account Management** link.

access.

3. Next, in the **Online Disk Access** section, select an **Online
Disk**, the level of Access, and then select the **Add** button when
you're finished.

*Note:* *Read access will allow that sub-account to open files in the
online disk, but they will be unable to make changes or delete files in
the online disk*. 

*Note: Read/Write access will allow that sub-account to open files in
the online disk and will also be able to make changes or delete files in
the online disk.*
