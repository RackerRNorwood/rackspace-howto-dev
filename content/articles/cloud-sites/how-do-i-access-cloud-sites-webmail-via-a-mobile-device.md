**Note:** This article refers to a feature that is no longer available
for Cloud Sites. It is provided for legacy support only.

You can access a mobile version of the webmail client by going to
[mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile](http://mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile "http://mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile").

You can also substitute your domain for **emailsrvr.com** when pointing
to our name servers or if you have the appropriate CNAME records set up
on your current name servers. (If you're pointing to our name servers,
then by default these records are set up, unless you modified them.)

For instructions for setting up email on your mobile devices, see
[Configure your email account on your
iPhone](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configure-your-cloud-sites-email-account-on-your-iphone).
