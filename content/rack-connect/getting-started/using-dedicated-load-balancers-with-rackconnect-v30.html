<p><strong>Applies to</strong>: RackConnect v3.0</p>

<p>Load balancers distribute workloads across two or more servers, network links or other resources. This distribution maximizes throughput, minimizes response time and helps avoid overload. This article discusses the options that are available when you use dedicated load balancers with RackConnect v3.0.<br />

<h3><strong>Supported load balancers</strong></h3>

<p>With RackConnect v3.0, the dedicated F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and Brocade ADX Series load balancers are now supported for use with the RackConnect automated pool membership management capabilities.&nbsp; When your cloud servers host an application that scales up and down (for example, the web tier of an application), it is important to have a method for adding and removing cloud servers from their associated load balancer pools. If you use a dedicated load balancer with RackConnect, you can specify the load balancer pool that a cloud server should be placed in when it is created. When you delete the cloud server, it will automatically be removed from the pool.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
RackConnect provides the following ways for you to associate your cloud servers with one or more load balancer pools:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#option1">Use the Cloud Control Panel</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Option2">Use the RackConnect v3.0 API</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><br />
<strong><a id="option1" name="option1"></a>Use the Cloud Control Panel</strong></h3>

<p>After you initially create your cloud server by using the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>, the management page for the newly created cloud server is displayed. On this page, you can see details regarding your server.</p>

<p>In the RackConnect Details section (located directly below the Server Details section), you have the option to manage (add or remove) the cloud server from a list of automation-compatible load balancer pools.</p>

<p><strong>To add a server to a load balancer pool</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>In the RackConnect Details&nbsp;section of the cloud server’s management page, click <strong>Select Pools</strong>.<br />
	<img alt="" height="241" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Fig3_REACH_LB_Pool_Modal_PNG_smaller-border.png" width="500" /></li>
	<li>In the popup dialog box, select the check box for each load balancer pool to which you want to add the cloud server.</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save Selected Load Balancer Pool(s)</strong>&nbsp;to save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To remove a server from a&nbsp; load balancer pool</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>In the RackConnect Details section of the cloud server’s management page, click&nbsp;<strong>Select Pools</strong>.</li>
	<li>Clear the check box for each load balancer pool from which you want to remove the cloud server.</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save Selected Load Balancer Pool(s)</strong>&nbsp;to save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Automation-compatible load balancer pools</strong></p>

<p>For load balancer pools to be recognized by RackConnect automation, the following requirements must be met:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At least one pool member exists. A disabled pool member (existing, but not actively used) is used as a placeholder by default.</li>
	<li>All pool members use the same forwarding port</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not see any available pools, when adding pool members from the control panel (in the <strong>Load Balancer pools</strong> section&nbsp;under &nbsp;<strong>RackConnect Details</strong>), RackConnect automation was not able to detect any automation-compatible load balancer pools on your dedicated load balancer. If this is the case, contact Rackspace Network Security to request the creation of one or more load balancer pools that are RackConnect automation-ready.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong><a id="Option2" name="Option2"></a>Use the RackConnect v3.0 API</strong></h3>

<p>After you initially create a cloud server, you can use the following RackConnect v3.0 API load balancer pool operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Retrieve a list of load balancer pools</li>
	<li>Retrieve pool details for a given load balancer pool</li>
	<li>Retrieve a list of all pool member nodes for a given load balancer pool</li>
	<li>Retrieve details for a given pool member node (servers) within a given load balancer pool</li>
	<li>Add a pool member node to a given load balancer pool</li>
	<li>Remove a pool member node from a given load balancer pool</li>
	<li>Bulk add multiple pool member nodes to one or more load balancer pools</li>
	<li>Bulk remove multiple pool member nodes from one or more load balancer pools</li>
</ul>

<p>The RackConnect v3.0 API is region-specific and returns results only for the region specified in the URL of the API call itself.</p>
