<p>When you transfer your .uk domain into a new registrar, you must ensure that the Internet Provider Security (IPS) tag points to the correct place before you begin the transfer process. If you are transferring your domain registration to Rackspace, the IPS tag must point to TUCOWS-CA.<br />&nbsp;<br />To change the IPS tag, contact your current Domain Registrar and request the change (some providers might&nbsp; charge an administration fee).</p>
