<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>This example demonstrates how to use a private key to log in to a Linux server with a private key by using a Terminal session on OS X. However, you can follow the same process to use a private key when using any terminal software on Linux.</p>

<p>You need two software applications to complete this process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>ssh – SSH client software is installed on your Linux or OS X operating system by default</li>
	<li>Your favorite text editor</li>
</ol>

<p>In this example, we use the vim text editor.</p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong> These instructions apply to the Linux and OS X operating systems.&nbsp; For information about using SSH private keys on Windows operating systems, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows">Logging in with an SSH Private Key on Windows</a>.</p>

<h4>Logging in with a private key</h4>

<p>Using your favorite text editor, create a file to store your private key. In this example, we use the file deployment_key.txt.</p>

<p>To edit the file in vim, type the following command</p>

<pre>
   vim deployment_key.txt
</pre>

<p>After the editor starts, press 'i' to turn on insert mode. Then, paste the private key into the file.<br />
Note that you need to include the <strong>BEGIN</strong> and <strong>END</strong> lines to use the private key.<br />

<p>To save your changes, press Escape. Then, type ‘:wq’ to write the file and return to the command line.<br />
After saving the file, run the following command to change the file permissions to 600 to secure the key. You can also set them to 400. <strong><em>This step is required</em></strong>:</p>

<pre>
    chmod 600 deployment_key.txt
</pre>

<p>After saving the key, use it to login to the SSH client as shown in this example that loads the key in file <strong>deployment_key.txt</strong>, and logs in as user <strong>demo</strong>,to IP <strong>192.237.248.66</strong>:</p>

<pre>
    ssh -i deployment_key.txt demo@192.237.248.66
</pre>

<p>When the prompt displays to confirm the connection request, type <strong>yes</strong>. Then, hit enter. If your SSH key requires a password, you will be prompted to enter it to complete the connection.</p>
