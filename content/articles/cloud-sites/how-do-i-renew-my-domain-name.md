*Note: This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control
Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com). You can access this interface
from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by
clicking your username in the upper-right of the control panel and
selecting "Cloud Sites Control Panel".*

1.  Login to your Cloud Sites Control Panel at
    [http://manage.rackspacecloud.com](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com "http://manage.rackspacecloud.com").
2.  Click on the **Hosting** button on the left navigation menu. Then
    select **Cloud Sites**.
3.  Click on the domain name you would like to renew.
4.  Click on the **DNS** tab and then click on the **Renew** button
    (please see the note below if the **Renew** button is not visible).
5.  Select the term (in years) you would like to renew for and click
    **next**.
6.  Click on the **Finish** button on the following screen to confirm
    the charges and complete the renewal.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

It's important to note that the following may not work if you have
changed your main account password or client's account password at any
point since you created either account.

You can always try the steps above and if you find that the "renew"
button is not visible when viewing the "Domain" tab for a Cloud Site
domain you know you purchased with us (must show **Click and Name** as
the Registrar when you perform a whois lookup), you may want to login to
[http://manage.opensrs.net](http://manage.opensrs.net "http://manage.opensrs.net")
with your original password and update the password in this control
panel to reflect your current password to re-establish this
functionality.

Clients do not have the ability to renew their domain names from the
Control Panel if it has already expired. If their domain has already
expired, they would need to contact Support. 

If you require clarification on this process, please contact support via
phone, chat or ticket.
