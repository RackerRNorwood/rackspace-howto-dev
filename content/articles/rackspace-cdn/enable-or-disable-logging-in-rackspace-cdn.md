CDN](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/access-rackspace-cdn).
2. In the list of CDN services, click the name of the service for which
you want to enable or disable logging.
3. In the **Service Details** section, click **Enable Logging**. A
popup dialog box appears. Note the information about managing the data
that is stored.

**Service Status** is **Pending** until the value for **Logging**
changes to **Enabled**.
