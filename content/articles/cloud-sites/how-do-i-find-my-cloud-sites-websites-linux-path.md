undefined&rsquo;s Linux path

3.  Click on the name of the website for which you need to obtain the
    Linux path.
4.  Click the **Features** tab.
5.  Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Server-side Paths**
    section.\
     Under **Linux Info**, the absolute path to your Linux PHP site is
    the one labeled **Web directory**. The path should resemble the
