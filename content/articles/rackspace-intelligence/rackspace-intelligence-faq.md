### What is Rackspace Intelligence?

Rackspace Intelligence delivers an intuitive interface that gives you a
transparent view into the health of your infrastructure, along with
actionable insights to improve system performance and availability. It
provides a universal dashboard that enables you to obtain information
about any monitoring tools and entities regardless of your underlying
infrastructure. You can use it to configure monitoring on your entities,
such as servers and databases, and view their monitoring status. It also
provides visualizations that give you a view of the trends in your
resource use.

Features

### What is an entity?

An *entity* is a resource (for example, a website or server) that you
want to monitor.

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### Do I need to create entities manually to monitor them?

Rackspace Intelligence automatically creates entities for all of your
Rackspace cloud servers and databases. If you want to monitor other
systems, you must manually create entities for them.

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### What is a check?

A *check* specifies the aspect of the resource that you want to monitor.

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### What is an alarm?

An *alarm* is a set of rules that determine what status is returned
based on the result of the check.

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### Why are the concepts of checks and alarms separate?

<span>We wanted to build a state-of-the-art monitoring platform, which
requires that data collection be separate from thresholds.</span>

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### What is a notification?

A *notification* defines how the customer wants to be contacted in the
case of a system failure.

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### What is a notification plan?

<span>A *notification plan* specifies a set of actions that are
performed when a certain status is returned by the check.</span>

^[back\\ to\\ top](#top)^

### What features will be available in the future?

We plan to provide the following features in future releases:

-   Customizable dashboards: Provides the ability to customize your
    dashboard in Rackspace Intelligence by adding widgets for graphs,
    drag-and-drop widgets, and more.
-   Details for a monitoring alert: Provides a single page with all the
    relevant information and insights to help you understand why an
    issue happened and what steps are needed to resolve it.
-   Access to Rackspace Intelligence for Rackspace Dedicated customers:
    Provides the ability for Dedicated customers to also access
    Rackspace Intelligence for their devices.
