<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> RackConnect v2.0</p>

<p>For the Rackspace Open Cloud offering, the image list for RackConnect customers with the Managed Infrastructure service level has been simplified. If your RackConnect implementation is complete, you can select any of the base images displayed in your image list (via the API, <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/">MyRackspace Portal</a>, or the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>), and we can configure RackConnect on your cloud servers. This is now true for Windows and Linux images, as well as for Managed Operations service level and Managed Infrastructure service level customers.</p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Some images at the Managed Infrastrucutre level are incompatiable with RackConnect. You can find a list of these images <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-server-images-for-use-with-rackconnect-v20">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Server flavors and regions</h2>

<p>In the MyRackspace Portal and Cloud Control Panel, you can choose the <em>flavor</em> of server that you want to provision. You can choose from standard and workload-optimized flavors. When creating new cloud servers, always be sure to select the <em>region</em> where your RackConnect configuration is located.</p>

<h2>Cloud Servers API “access IP”</h2>

<p>The <em>access IP</em> is the IP address used by RackConnect automation to access the server. This value is accessible via the API. <em>Access IP</em>&nbsp;is already part of the MyRackspace Portal and is being added to the Cloud Control Panel soon. At the time a server is built, it is populated with the public IP address of the server. In the case of a cloud server connected through RackConnect, the RackConnect automation updates the access IP to reflect the public IP address assigned through Network Address Translation (NAT) through the RackConnect edge network device.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are accessIPv4 and accessIPv6 values in the API. RackConnect continues to be an IPv4-only solution, so only accessIPv4 reflects a value after the RackConnect automation has performed its post-build updates. Because these values can be updated via the public API, it is possible (although not recommended) for you to modify the values.</p>
