<h2><a id="checks" name="checks"></a>Checks</h2>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Rackspace Intelligence lets you view the configuration of checks that were created for an entity. Customers with dedicated accounts can use remote checks.&nbsp;Remote checks monitor an entity's Internet connectivity.&nbsp;Remote checks are performed by attempting to contact the entity from outside the entity. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-check-type-ref">Remote check types</a>.</p>

<p>Rackspace Intelligence for dedicated accounts supports the following remote checks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-ping">ping</a></p>

<h2><a id="alarms" name="alarms"></a>Alarms</h2>
