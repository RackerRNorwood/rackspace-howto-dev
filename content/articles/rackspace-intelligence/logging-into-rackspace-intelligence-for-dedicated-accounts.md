To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a dedicated Rackspace
customer account and you must be logged in to the 
[https://my.rackspace.com/](https://my.rackspace.com/) portal for that
account. Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.

To access Rackspace Intelligence
--------------------------------

1.  Go to [https://my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com) and log
    in to the portal by providing your **Rackspace Account Number**,
    **Username** and **Password**.<br>
      
2.  On the MyRackspace Customer Portal, click **Services** and then
    select **Availability Monitoring** from the list.<br>
     <br>

     <br>
     This takes you to the **Entities** page, which lists all of your
    available entities. From this page, you can explore all the details
    for the entities that have been configured for you.<br>
