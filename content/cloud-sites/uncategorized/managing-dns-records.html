<p>DNS records are like "phone books" for the Internet and can be very useful when additional information is needed. They contain information about every registered domain on the web; such as where email should be sent and who is the domain's hosting provider. If you host your DNS with Rackspace, you can manage your DNS Records through the control panel. Let's take a look at the following steps below to see how this is done:&nbsp;</p><p>1. First thing you'll want to do is login to your control panel at <a href="http://cp.rackspace.com">cp.rackspace.com</a>; once you're logged in you'll mouse over the&nbsp;<strong>Go to section</strong>&nbsp;drop-down menu and select&nbsp;<strong>Domains</strong>.</p><p><img style="width: 228px; height: 151px;" src="http://c800721.r21.cf2.rackcdn.com/UpdatingYourWhoisInformation.png" alt="" /></p><p>2. In the&nbsp;<strong>Manage</strong>&nbsp;section, click the&nbsp;<strong>DNS Settings</strong>&nbsp;link.</p><p><img src="http://c800721.r21.cf2.rackcdn.com/UpdatingYourWhoisInformation2.png" alt="" /></p><p>3. Search for the domain for which you want to manage DNS settings and click on the <strong>DNS Records</strong> link.</p><p><img style="width: 632px; height: 125px;" src="http://c806643.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/(E&amp;A)ManagingDNSRecords.png" alt="" /></p><p>4. Next, you will either choose between "<strong><strong>Use Rackspace Name servers</strong></strong>" or<strong>&nbsp;</strong>"<strong>Use Custom Name Servers</strong>." By default&nbsp;"<strong><strong>Use Rackspace Name servers</strong></strong>" will be chosen with entries already implemented for you. If&nbsp;you would like to use your own, choose&nbsp;"<strong>Use Custom Name Servers</strong>." Make your changes as needed and then select <strong>Save</strong>.</p><p><img style="width: 685px; height: 400px;" src="http://c806643.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/(E&amp;A)ManagingDNSRecords4.png" alt="" />&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note: Use Rackspace Name Servers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>must be selected for the Hosting and Mail Records sections to be visible. To add additional DNS records click the&nbsp;<strong>Add Additional Record</strong>&nbsp;button.</em></p>
