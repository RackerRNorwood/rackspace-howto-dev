<p><strong>Cluster</strong> A group of servers (nodes). In Cloud Big Data, the servers are virtual.</p><p><strong>HDFS</strong> The Apache Hadoop Distributed File System. This is the default file system used in Cloud Big Data.</p><p><strong>MapReduce</strong> A framework for performing calculations on the data in the distributed file system. Map tasks run in parallel with each other. Reduce tasks also run in parallel with each other.</p><p><strong>Node</strong> In a network, a node is a connection point, either a redistribution point or an end point for data transmissions. In general, a node has programmed or engineered capability to recognize and process or forward transmissions to other nodes.</p><p><strong>SCP Server Proxy</strong> An SCP service that runs on your Hadoop cluster and distributes your files across the cluster.</p><p><strong>Service Catalog</strong> Your service catalog is the list of services available to you, as returned along with your authentication token and an expiration date for that token. All the services in your service catalog should recognize your token as valid until it expires.</p><p>The catalog listing for each service provides at least one endpoint URL for that service. Other information, such as regions and versions and tenants, is provided if it is relevant to your access to this service.</p><p><strong>Tenant</strong> A container used to group or isolate resources or identity objects.
