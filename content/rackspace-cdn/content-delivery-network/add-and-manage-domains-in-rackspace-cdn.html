<p>You can add an additional domain to your service, and you must always create a CNAME for your service. The following sections provide information for these steps.</p>

<h3>Add a domain</h3>

<p>To add an additional domain to your service, following these steps:</p>

<p>1. On the <strong>CDN Service</strong> page in the <strong>Domains </strong>section, click <strong>Add a Domain</strong>.<br />
2. Select HTTP or HTTPS from <strong>Choose Traffic Type</strong>.<br />
3. For HTTP traffic, enter the <strong>Domain Name</strong>.<br />
4. For HTTPS traffic, select <strong>Shared SAN Certificate</strong> or <strong>Shared Rackspace Domain Certificate</strong> from <strong>Choose Certificate Type</strong>. Then enter the <strong>Domain Name</strong> of the domain that you want to add. For secure domains, the name must be a single word and cannot contain periods (.), but can contain hyphens (-).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Click<strong> Add Domain</strong>.&nbsp; In the <strong>Domains</strong> section, you can see the Domain Name, along with the <strong>Certificate Type</strong>, and the <strong>Status</strong> of the domain. Status will not show as <strong>Active</strong> until the SSL certificate has been provisioned and you have set the CNAME record for the domain. If the <strong>Status</strong> is <strong>Domain Not Configured</strong>, click on that text to get instructions and to see the Rackspace CDN URL (see the figure below) that you need for the CNAME record creation.</p>

<p>The instructions that see see when you click on <strong>Domain Not Configured </strong>are similar to those in the following figure:</p>

<p>It might take some time for your DNS change to propagate across the internet. After this has happened (based on the TTL you have set with your DNS provider), you will be able to access your website via the CDN edge.</p>
