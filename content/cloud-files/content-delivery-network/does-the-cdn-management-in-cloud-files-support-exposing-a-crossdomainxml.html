<p>Cloud Files CDN does not support exposing a custom crossdomain.xml file because this file is required by the Openstack Swift project, on which Cloud Files is based.</p>

<p>OpenStack Swift uses the crossdomain.xml file as a global configuration file for installation. The file cannot be modified for multiple tenants, such as our Rackspace Public Cloud.</p>

<p><span class="error">For more information, see <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/crossdomain.html">Cross-domain Policy File</a>.</span></p>

<p>If your site requires a custom crossdomain.xml file, we suggest you take a look at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cdn-content-delivery-network">Rackspace CDN</a>. Rackspace CDN allows you to customize your configuration and define your own origin web server.</p>
