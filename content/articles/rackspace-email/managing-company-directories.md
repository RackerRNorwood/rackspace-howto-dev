When you create a company directory, users in the directory have access
to up-to-date contact information for all users in the directory. Users
can access the company directory information through Webmail, via the
Contacts tab.

To view a company directory list, log into the control panel and perform
the following steps:<br>
  

1.  Click on the **Go to section** drop-down menu and select **Rackspace
    Email**.<br>
      
2.  In the **Collaboration** section, click the **Company
    Directory** link.<br>
      

From here, you can add, edit, or delete an alias. See the instructions
below specific to the action you would like to take.

 

Adding/Editing a Company Directory:<br>
  
------------------------------------

1.  While viewing the **Company Directory** list, click on the name of
    the directory you want to edit. If creating a new directory, click
    **Add Directory**.<br>
      
2.  Make changes as desired.<br>
      
    -   Use the**Name** box to change or create the directory&rsquo;s name.<br>
          
    -   To allow users to edit their personal contact information, check
        the **Allow users to edit their profile** box.<br>
          
    -   In the **Domains** section, click once on a domain you want to
        add to the directory, and then click **Add**. Use
        the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate a domain.<br>
         <br>
         **Note:** You can add several domains to the same directory,
        but each domain can belong to only one directory.<br>
          
    -   To make changes to members, click the **Add/Remove
        Members** tab. Use the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate
        the mailboxes you want to include, and then click **Add**.<br>
         <br>
         To add mailboxes that are outside your domain, type their email
        addresses in the **Add Members outside this Domain** box and
        click **Add**. Then, click on the newly listed email address and
        click on **Edit Contact Info**. Enter additional information as
        needed in the new window, and then click **Ok**.<br>
          

3.  Click **Save**.

 

Deleting a Company Directory<br>
  
-----------------------------

1.  Select the check box next to each directory you want to delete. Or,
    to select all directories, select the check box that appears next to
    **Delete**.<br>
      
2.  Click **Delete**.<br>
      
3.  A pop-up box will appear to confirm that you want to delete the
    directory. Click **Delete (\#) company directory**.
