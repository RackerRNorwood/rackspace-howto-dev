<h2 id="whatis">What is Cloud Feeds?</h2>

<p>Modern complex computing environments generate large amounts of data related to system events, security, and utilization of resources. For example, you might receive notifications to inform you that a server has rebooted, to inform you of a server's network bandwidth use for a time period, or in response to a security condition such as a failed login attempt.</p>

<p>Managing the information driven by event notifications is problematic when the data sources use different transmission formats and protocols. Gaining access to this information is further complicated when you are working with virtualized cloud-based systems because infrastructure-level event data might not be available to you. However, your ability to access, manage, and react to this information can have a major impact on your mission-critical processes and applications.</p>

<p>That’s where Cloud Feeds comes in.</p>

<p>The Cloud Feeds service accepts event notifications from other Rackspace Cloud services, validates them, and makes the information available to you in a reliable, secure, and standardized way. Critical business processes that rely on this information can now be enabled for the cloud, just as they are in an on-premises computing environment. In addition, because Cloud Feeds uses the Atom Publishing Protocol (RFC-5023) and Atom Syndication Formatted events (RFC-4287), you can access notifications from multiple Rackspace Cloud services by using a single protocol and format.</p>

<h2 id="howtogrant">How to grant users access to Cloud Feeds</h2>

<p>No registration is required to access Cloud Feeds; it is already available through the Cloud Control Panel. Log in and assign the <strong>cloudfeeds:observer</strong>&nbsp;role to one or more users by performing the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Cloud Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Account</strong> menu (your account name), select <strong>User Management</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the User Management page, click the name of the user that you want to modify.</li>
	<li>Under <strong>Product Access</strong>, ensure that the <strong>Custom (Per Product Access)</strong> option is selected.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Feeds</strong> menu, select <strong>Observer</strong>.</li>
	<li>Save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For more information about role-based access control, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/3403">Overview: Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="howtoaccess">How to access Cloud Feeds</h2>

<p>Cloud Feeds events are accessed via the simple Atom Publishing Protocol, which is HTTP-based. Several tools are available that can send HTTP requests and capture the output, including the following ones:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cURL, a command-line tool <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">(http://curl.haxx.se/)</a></li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox REST client <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/">(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/)</a></li>
	<li>Chrome Poster <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chrome-poster/">(https://code.google.com/p/chrome-poster/)</a></li>
	<li>RESTclient, a Java application used to test RESTful web services <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/">(http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve events from a feed, send an HTTP GET request to the appropriate URL. The URL depends on the <em>data center</em>, <em>feed name</em>, and your <em>tenant ID</em>. You need a valid <em>authentication token</em> to make the request.</p>

<p>By default, the 25 most current events are retrieved first. You can specify how many events to retrieve, or modify search parameters to retrieve only events that match a certain criteria. The results are returned in Atom Syndication Format, which includes information to help you navigate the list of events in the feed.</p>
