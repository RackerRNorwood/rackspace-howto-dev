<p>Everyone who has a Rackspace cloud account can use the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel to create and manage devices and the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to observe infrastructure status.</p>

<p>As you create new servers and databases with your cloud account, Rackspace Intelligence automatically recognizes them as entities. By taking some extra steps, you can enable Rackspace Intelligence to give you full information on the status of those entities.</p>

<p>If you explicitly define something other than a cloud server or cloud database as an entity, Rackspace Intelligence can also monitor its status.</p>
