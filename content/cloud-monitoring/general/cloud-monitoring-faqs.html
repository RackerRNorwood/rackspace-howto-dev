<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>How many zones can I monitor my resources from?</h3>

<p>There are six monitoring zones:</p>

<ul>
     <li>Blacksburg (IAD)</li>
     <li>Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)</li>
     <li>Chicago (ORD)</li>
     <li>London (LON)</li>
     <li>Hong Kong (HKG)</li>
     <li>Sydney (SYD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using multiple monitoring zones eliminates the need for maintenance and upgrade downtime, as well as ensures your monitoring services remain uninterrupted even in the event of a datacenter failure. You can find an up-to-date list of monitoring zones in the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-index">Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the various terms I need to know when using Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-concepts>Concepts</a> section in the Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How do I configure my monitoring system?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Monitoring is an API-based system. You can access it using the following methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/control-panel-monitoring-what-do-the-options-do">Cloud Control Panel</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-rackspace-monitoring-cli">raxmon command line inteface (CLI)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/">Rackspace Monitoring API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To set a monitoring check using the Cloud Control Panel, log into the Control Panel and go the Server Details page of a Cloud Server. Then scroll down to the Monitoring Checks section and click Create Check.</p>

<p>If you would like to&nbsp;practice setting up a monitoring check&nbsp;using the CLI,&nbsp;consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-getting-started">Rackspace Monitoring Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the ways to receive an alert when my website is down?</h3>

<p>We currently support email, SMS, PagerDuty, VictorOps and webhook. You can find the most up-to-date information in the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-type-operations">Notification types</a> section in the Rackspace Monitoring Developer's Guide.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What does Rackspace Monitoring actually monitor?</h3>

<p>Anything with a URL or an IP address that is not blocked by a firewall. You can find more information in the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/check-operations">Checks</a> section in the Rackspace Monitoring Developer's Guide.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What do I need Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>As the complexity of your business increases with the number of products, customers, websites, etc., there is an increasing possibility of one or more of your resources suffering from a variety of system failures. Learning of a problem from your customers means that you’ve already lost business, and your customers are already having a negative experience using your website or application. Preventing this is what Rackspace Monitoring is all about.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Monitoring is an API driven cloud service built for infrastructure monitoring. It offers a simple yet powerful feature-set, allowing extreme flexibility in configuration and execution.  Very simply, we help answer the question, “Is my service up and running?” To do that, we have two simple objectives; to alert the resource owner before their customer knows, and to take measure against allowing the system to go down in the first place.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<hr>

<h2>Account Services</h2>

<h3>Can I use a UK account as well as a US account?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can use both US and UK accounts. This is a global system that works with both identities. Use the identity server where your tenant lives and pass that token and tenantId to the Rackspace Monitoring system.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is High Availability?</h3>

<p>High availability is a feature unique to Rackspace Monitoring. Because we provide Monitoring as a Service hosted in the cloud, we are able to keep that service up and running without any downtime. When implementing improvements to the system, we can take a region down for an upgrade, even lose another data center due to a localized disaster or event, and Rackspace Monitoring will continue to monitor your resources and send you notifications.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Where can I tell Rackspace about features I would like added or issues I discover while using Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>Please let us know of any features you would like added or any issues you find via the <a href="https://feedback.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Product Feedback</a> forums. For more immediate assistance with a time-sensitive issue, please file a ticket or contact your account team.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Will you support SNMP traps?</h3>

<p>Not yet, but we are planning on starting in the near future.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<hr>

<h2>Notification Plans</h2>

<h3>What is a notification plan?</h3>

<p>A notification plan contains a set of actions that Rackspace Monitoring executes when triggered by an alarm. You may have multiple notification plans in your cloud account.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How are notifications used?</p>

<p>Each monitoring check can reference one notification plan. When an alarm for that check triggers the critical state, the notification plan associated with the check is used.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What does the default notification plan, Technical Contracts - Email, do?</h3>

<p>If you do not set up a custom notification plan, then by default, email is sent to all of the technical contacts on your account. If your account lists no technical contacts, then the primary contact is emailed. You can view the list of contacts for your account on the User Management Page in the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What does the Rackspace Managed Notifications plan do?</h3>

<p>It creates a support ticket within your account. This feature is available only to customers with a Managed Operations service level. </p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How do I set up a custom notification plan?</h3>

<p>You can use the Rackspace Monitoring API. For instructions, see the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/">Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Where can I download the Rackspace Monitoring CLI?</h3>

<p>You can find the download for the Rackspace Monitoring CLI on the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rackspace-monitoring-cli/0.4.5">Python website</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Where can I find the API documentation for Rackspace Monitoring notification plans?</h3>

<p>You can find information about Rackspace Monitoring <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-plans-operations">notification plans</a> in the Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Aren't my cloud resources already being monitored?</h3>

<p>We will only notify you when there is a problem with our infrastructure that impacts your Cloud resource. We do not run monitoring checks on your individual Cloud Servers, Cloud Load Balancers, or websites to verify functionality.  This leaves a lot of exposure in situations where the infrastructure is working fine, but a given application or resource in your Cloud setup has stopped functioning correctly, leaving your site performance degraded, or totally inaccessible.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What kind of additional monitoring is available for my cloud resources?</h3>

<p>It can take a lot of administrative overhead in order to correctly configure and maintain a robust monitoring application.  If there is no built-in redundancy for the monitoring application, you could lose all monitoring services if the server hosting your monitoring application runs into trouble.  A simpler option, with built-in redundancy, is to use the newly available Rackspace Monitoring service.  It provides you with four key pieces of information that can help you manage your business as well as address and prevent infrastructure problems before they affect your customers.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How do I set up Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Monitoring is released through the cloud without need for software installation on servers or computers. By eliminating the need for installation, Rackspace can upgrade the monitoring service without involving the customer. This process hides the complexity of the upgrade and maintenance processes from the customer, giving them a simple and reliable experience.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Can I view historical metrics for monitoring checks?</h3>

<p>You can access metrics for a check directly by using the <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/metrics-operations">Rackspace Monitoring API</a>.  You can also access metrics by using the <a href="https://intelligence.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Intelligence portal</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How do I submit commands through the Rackspace Monitoring API?</h3>

<p>As with any commands you will submit to your Cloud resources through the API, you must first authenticate through the API in order for the commands to be correctly processed.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/">Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide</a>, we show the detailed configuration options available with this service offering, and the necessary components to build functioning monitoring checks.  This will require you to work with the following components:</p>

<ul>
     <li>Account - An account contains attributes describing your account. This description contains mostly read only data; however, a few properties can be modified with the API.</li>
     <li>Entities - An entity is a resource that you want to monitor. Some examples are a server, a website, or a service.</li>
     <li>Checks  - Checks explicitly specify how you want to monitor an entity.</li>
     <li>Check Types - These are the available service monitoring checks that you can configure, such as PING, HTTPS, SMTP (and many more).</li>
     <li>Monitoring Zones - A monitoring zone is the "launch point" of a check. You can launch checks from multiple monitoring zones.</li>
     <li>Alarms - An alarm contains a set of rules that determine when a notification is triggered.</li>
     <li>Notifications - A notification is an informational message sent to one or more addresses when an alarm is triggered.</li>
     <li>Notification Plans - A notification plan is a set of notification rules to execute when an alarm is triggered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Is there a discount for companies that need to monitor in bulk?</h3>

<p>Please contact our sales department in order to make a custom service plan that will both cover your monitoring needs and fit your budget.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>If I am a Managed Servers customer, may I use this?</h3>

<p>Yes, but you will need a Cloud account. You configure your own notifications, so alerts may only go to you (the user).  A Racker will not respond to your alarms unless they are included in the notifications.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Will this be available globally or US only?</h3>

<p>This is a global product which is supported in both the US and UK. We have a primary datacenter in the UK that can process alerts on its own if the link between the US and UK goes down, as well as other datacenters that act as safety nets in case of localized datacenter failure; no matter what, your monitoring service will remain functional.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is a Monitoring Zone?</h3>

<p>A monitoring zone is the “launch point” of a check.  You can launch checks from multiple monitoring zones.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is an Alarm?</h3>

<p>An Alarm is a set of rules that determine what status is returned based on the result of the check.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What mechanism do we use to check that the site content is reliably correct?</h3>

<p>At this time, we don’t do "synthetic transactions” (a simulated set of actions.) However, we do support checking the HTML of the response. We follow redirects but don’t check content within a frame/iframe.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is a Notification Plan?</h3>

<p>A Notification Plan is a set of actions undertaken when a certain status is returned by the check.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Do we have a detailed 'recipe' or plan for how to monitor a hosted app?</h3>

<p>Right now we have a Getting Started Guide which is an evolving document that is updated on a regular basis. This guide includes situations set up as well as just an overview of how to use some of the tools to start getting value. We are working on setting up a feedback site for dealing with customer feature requests.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is a Notification?</h3>

<p>A Notification defines how the customer wants to be contacted in the case of a system failure.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How secure is the Rackspace Monitoring system?</h3>

<p>The Rackspace Monitoring system is extremely secure. Before releasing the product, an independent firm assessed the level of security of the Rackspace Monitoring systems and API, and all reported issues have been addressed. You can have confidence that Rackspace Monitoring is both safe and secure.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is a Check?</h3>

<p>A Check specifies what aspect of the resource you wish to monitor.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What’s the most important aspect of Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>The user experience. At Rackspace, we strive to make your interactions with us and our products as easy as possible, and we work towards improving that experience every day. Rackspace Monitoring was built first and foremost with the user in mind - we want your experience to be even easier than ours when using the product.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is an Entity?</h3>

<p>An Entity is the resource (website, server, etc) you wish to monitor.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Once I’ve made a check, how will I know it works?</h3>

<p>We have an on-demand simulation feature which allows the user to test the functionality of their monitoring system by simulating a normal operating situation.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Why do you not have everything other monitoring services have?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Monitoring was built as a means, not an end. Although just as (and in many aspects, more) advanced than the other monitoring services, Rackspace Monitoring has promoted reliable functionality and a solid foundation over superficial “whizz bang” features. This is by no means the final product - we plan to continue innovating and improving on what we have already, which is a solid, reliable foundation for the future. Customer feedback remains a very valuable source of input concerning the direction of Rackspace Monitoring.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How responsive is the system to change, especially in large numbers?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Monitoring tries very hard to make sure that if a change fails it let's the customer know.  Deliberate action is necessary in a monitoring system. Along with that scalability has been one of our priorities from the beginning. Even if a customer adds thousands of Cloud Servers in minutes, Rackspace Monitoring can instantly begin monitoring all of them.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How does this compare to open source solutions like Nagios?<h3>

<p>It is targeted at replacing these type of tools. Right now we don’t offer all the features of Nagios; however, Rackspace Monitoring is hosted as a service, API driven and built for the cloud. Rackspace Monitoring also provides geographically redundant checks which is something that is generally very difficult to get with any solution. Customers will get to leverage our big datacenter footprint, incredible scalability, and our continuous release feature. Future improvements to the service will be released as they become functional (no need to wait for an upgrade package, and no need for downtime).</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Will there be an API call or published URI to get all the collector IPs as with Cloudkick?</h3>

<p>Listing monitoring zones will give you CIDR’s of the set of collectors in that zone.  To get the most accurate list possible use this API call.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Does "60 day retention" mean "default 60 days on all customer alert log data"? If so, can customers ask that it be less than 60 days for some bizarre reason?</h3>

<p>Not today, we will have more flexibility in setting policies in the future though.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Are there good patterns to use to better leverage the alarm language?</h3>

<p>Most of the interesting patterns are represented here. Let us know in the comments if there are additional examples you’d like to contribute.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How are Email notifications sent? Do I need to worry they will end up in my SPAM folder?</h3>

<p>Email notifications are sent via Mailgun. They make sure that email will be sent properly and not placed into SPAM folders.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Why separate out the check/alarm concept?</h3>

<p>We wanted to build a state of the art monitoring platform. This requires the data collection to be separate from the thresholding. On the CLI/API level, this is a more complex user experience, but provides the most flexibility. The dashboard GUI simplifies the process for those users who don’t want to work with a CLI.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>I've heard about this Alarm Language. How does it work?</h3>

<p>The alarm language is one of the coolest features in the product. In past experiences, we've discovered that building an API around thresholds was really cumbersome. So we decided to represent thresholds in a javascript-like language. It gives you the ability to write some very concise thresholds. For a list of examples, see <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#best-practices-for-creating-alerts">Best practices for creating alerts</a> in the Rackspace Monitoring Developer Guide. 

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>What is the production URL?</h3>

<p>The production URL is <a href="https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com">https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Is there a set of command line tools to use with Rackspace Monitoring?</h3>

<p>Yes. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/racker/rackspace-monitoring-cli">raxmon project</a>. It uses the Apache Libcloud framework for building a reliable API implementation that functions well.</p>

<p>To avoid repeating the raxmon installation on each new Cloud Server, install it on your workstation and not your server.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: raxmon requires Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Is there a good tutorial for customers unfamiliar with monitoring in general?</h3>

<p>Yes - please visit our <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-getting-started">Rackspace Monitoring Getting Started Guide</a>, which can guide you through the steps in creating your Rackspace Monitoring setup from scratch.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>Why would I want to monitor from multiple monitoring zones?</h3>

<p>Monitoring from multiple monitoring zones allows you to monitor the experience of customers from many locations, which is important for companies that do business in more than one region. Consider this: your website might be working fine in the Western United States, but users from the Eastern half of the country are experiencing high load times and non-responsive web pages. Monitoring from just a western data center would report an OK status, but if you also monitor from the eastern data center, you will be alerted to this problem before it affects your customers.</p>

<p>If you’re only monitoring from a single zone, and for some reason there is an error with a check, you may get false notifications that your site has a problem, when in reality it is working fine. Using multiple monitoring zones helps prevent these false alarms by verifying a system failure from multiple sources before alerting you. Or, you can have it send you a message if even just one check returns a failure status - the level of customization possible through our alarm language is incredible.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h2>API</h2>

<h3>How do you see monitors for both your Dedicated and Cloud Servers?</h3>

<p>Through the API by using a check: <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/check-operations">here</a>.</p>

<p>Through the Raxmon CLI: <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#using-the-raxmon-client">here</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3>How fast and easy is it to work with the API?</h3>

<p>You must set up your account at the Rackspace Cloud account signup process <a href="https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/">here</a>. &nbsp;Once complete, adding incremental monitoring is fast and easy, especially in the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>
