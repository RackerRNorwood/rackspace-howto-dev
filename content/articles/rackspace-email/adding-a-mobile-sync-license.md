In order to setup Webmail Mobile Sync with your Rackspace Email account
on your mobile device, you'll need to add an Activesync or BlackBerry
Enterprise Service (BES) license through the Cloud Office Control Panel.
The following article will demonstrate how to add a Activesync or BES
license; let's take a look:

 

1.  First, login to the control panel
    at [cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com). Once you are logged
    in, select M**obile Sync** under Other Options in the Rackspace
    Email box.

2.  On the Activate Mobile Sync page, you will see a list of available
    users to choose from. Select the users to activate by checking the
    box on the left of them, or you can select the **Add Mobile Sync to
    all mailboxes on this domain** located at the top. Once you are
    finished, select **Save**at the bottom.
