<p>Rackspace hereby announces the full deprecation of the Rackspace::Cloud::Server resource in Cloud Orchestration as of November&nbsp;1, 2015. As of this date,&nbsp;Rackspace will automatically map references to&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server&nbsp;to refer to OS::Nova::Server instead.&nbsp;This means that after deprecation, while the references to Rackspace::Cloud::Server are automatically remapped, using&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server&nbsp;will be the same as using OS::Nova::Server.</p>

<p>In due time, however, the&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server resource will be completely removed. For this reason, <u>it is recommended that you switch to using&nbsp;OS::Nova::Server resource in your templates instead of Rackspace::Cloud::Server&nbsp;resource as soon as is feasible.&nbsp;</u></p>

<p><u>You will not be impacted</u> if you have created stacks using our pre-built Rackspace templates without modifying the templates. This is because we have already made the required changes to our pre-built templates.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>You may be impacted</u>&nbsp;if you are using custom-built Heat templates, or if you have modified any of our pre-built Rackspace templates to suit your needs. Please continue to read this article.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Why is Rackspace doing this?</h2>

<p>Rackspace::Cloud::Server was intended as a stopgap to accommodate the initial lack of support for Cloud Init on Rackspace Public Cloud as well as to accommodate certain provisioning extensions in our Cloud Servers product. Cloud Init is now supported on Rackspace Public Cloud and other functionality has been integrated into OS::Nova::Server. Our&nbsp;overarching goal has always been to support portability of templates across OpenStack clouds, and support resources as close to OpenStack trunk as possible. To this end, by moving away from Rackspace::Cloud::Server and adopting OS::Nova::Server, the service&nbsp;becomes more consistent with this goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are the key behavioral changes?</h2>

<p>OS::Nova::Server will not provide the following capabilities that&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server provides&nbsp;by default:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The server became&nbsp;active only after user data execution completed.</li>
	<li>If user data script execution had a failure, the server create would show as failed.</li>
	<li>The pre-assigned&nbsp;server admin password could be retrieved without any additional instrumentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>What do I need to do to accommodate this change? Are there workarounds to mimic past behavior?</h2>

<p>If you are already using OS::Nova::Server successfully in your templates, and the above three behavioral changes don't impact your use case, you do not need to make any changes. However, if you need any of these functionalities, the workarounds are described below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The server became&nbsp;active only after user data execution completed.
	<p>After deprecation,&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server&nbsp;will be the same as OS::Nova::Server. The server state will turn to active within a certain time period, even if user data script execution has not completed. To address this functionality, you can&nbsp;include Swift Signal resources (OS::Heat::SwiftSignal and OS::Heat::SwiftSignalHandle) to indicate&nbsp;whether the user data script completed. For detailed documentation and examples for using Swift Signal resources, please refer to this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-swift-signal-resources-to-determine-status-for-cloud-orchestration-user-data-scripts">article</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>If user data script execution had a failure, the server create would show as failed.
	<p>After deprecation,&nbsp;Rackspace::Cloud::Server&nbsp;will be the same as OS::Nova::Server. They&nbsp;will&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;throw an error if user data script execution fails. Rather, they will assume that user data succeeded.&nbsp;To address this functionality, you can include Swift Signal resources (OS::Heat::SwiftSignal and OS::Heat::SwiftSignalHandle) to indicate&nbsp;whether the user data scripts succeed or failed. For detailed documentation and examples on this, please refer to this <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-swift-signal-resources-to-determine-status-for-cloud-orchestration-user-data-scripts">article</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The pre-assigned&nbsp;server admin password could be retrieved without any &nbsp;additional instrumentation.
	<p>After deprecation, Rackspace::Cloud::Server will be the same as OS::Nova::Server. Cloud Orchestration will not store the admin password with the server resource. In order to retrieve the admin password in the outputs section, you can specify the password as n input parameter or use a resource to generate a password and pass it to Server resource. For example, you can use the OS::Heat::RandomString resource (which will create a random string) to create the password.&nbsp;An example template snippet of how this would work is shown below:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
heat_template_version: '2013-05-23'

	outputs:

	&nbsp; AdminPass:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; description: Value of Admin Password

	&nbsp; &nbsp; value:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get_attr: [OSHeatRandomString, value]

	resources:

	&nbsp; OSHeatRandomString:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; properties: {}

	&nbsp; &nbsp; type: OS::Heat::RandomString

	&nbsp; OSNovaServer:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; properties:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; admin_pass:

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get_attr: [OSHeatRandomString, value]

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flavor: ''

	&nbsp; &nbsp; type: OS::Nova::Server</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mechanism shown above can be used to set and retrieve the admin password instead of the way it was used earlier with Rackspace::Cloud::Server. As mentioned earlier, the <em>technique shown below will</em> <em>not</em> work after deprecation is complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
heat_template_version: '2013-05-23'

       outputs:

          AdminPass:

           description: Value of Admin Password

        value:

             get_attr: [RackspaceServer, admin_pass]

     resources:

      RackspaceServer:

         properties:

         flavor: ''

        type: Rackspace::Cloud::Server
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Further questions?</h2>

<p>Contact Rackspace via normal support channels and ask for help with the Orchestration service, with using Heat templates, or to voice any concerns you might have specific to this deprecation notice.&nbsp;</p>
