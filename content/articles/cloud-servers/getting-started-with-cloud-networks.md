Cloud Networks lets you create and manage secure, isolated networks in
the cloud.  These networks are fully single tenant and you have complete
control over the network topology, IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6), and
which Cloud Servers are attached.  Cloud Networks are regional in scope
and can be attached to any of your Cloud Servers in a given region.
 Cloud Servers can also be attached to multiple Cloud Networks.  Cloud
Networks can be combined with [Brocade Vyatta
vRouters](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/vrouter/) to create
more complex topologies to route traffic between Cloud Networks or to
external data centers over VPN.  Cloud Networks can be created and
managed via API or using the Rackspace Cloud Control
Panel. <span> </span>

Using Cloud Networks
---------------------

You can use the Cloud Control Panel or the [Cloud Servers
API](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/) to manage Cloud Networks.
This section provides links to both the Cloud Control Panel help
articles and API developer resources.
