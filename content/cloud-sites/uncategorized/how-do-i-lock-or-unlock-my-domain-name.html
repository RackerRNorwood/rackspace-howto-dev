<p>You will need to contact the company that you have chosen to register your domain through to request to have your domain locked or unlocked. If you purchased your domain through Cloud Sites you are welcome to contact the support team to have the domain locked or unlocked.</p><p>If you are unsure who your domain registrar is, please <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_do_a_WHOIS_search%3F" title="How do I do a WHOIS search?">do a WHOIS lookup on your domain</a>. The results should have the section such as <strong>ICANN Registrar: YOUR_REGISTRAR</strong> which will be the company you need to contact for all of your domain needs.</p>
