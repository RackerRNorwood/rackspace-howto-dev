Rackspace sends ALL used compute/storage/network/drives (e-waste) to a
certified electronics refurbisher that is under contract with Rackspace.
This insures that all assets are securely and responsibly processed. We
are working on an &ldquo;Employee Purchase Program&rdquo; with the refurbishing
company to offer Rackers discounts on purchasing used/lower cost gear
that has been cleaned, tested and carries a limited warranty. Stay tuned
for more on this.
