You can do a WHOIS search to find the administrative email and the
current registrar for the domain. A WHOIS search reveals details about a
domain name, including who owns it, where it was registered, when it
expires, and which name servers are assigned to the domain. There are
many software tools for performing a WHOIS search, and you can also
search online. One good web site to try
is [http://whois.domaintools.com/](http://whois.domaintools.com/).
