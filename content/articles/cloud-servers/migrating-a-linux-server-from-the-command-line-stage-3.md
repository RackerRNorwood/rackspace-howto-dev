undefined&rsquo;t other changes you made on the
origin server related to the database (like cron jobs or logrotate
configuration). Then start or restart the database service on the
destination and get to testing.

enjoying the results. Congratulations! But do remember to test
thoroughly before going into production with the new server. Surprises
are bad (on a server, anyway).
