<p>Restriction rules limit who can see your content. Restriction rules define the traffic to <em>allow</em> or to <em>block</em>. (For example, a <strong>Referrer</strong> value of <strong>website.com</strong> with <strong>Allow</strong> chosen, <em>allows</em> traffic being requested from <strong>website.com</strong>. If <strong>Block</strong> is chosen, traffic is denied.)</p>

<p>When you create multiple rules, you must order rules from least specific to most specific.</p>

<p>For more information about rules, see the following sections and <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cdn-edge-rules">Rackspace CDN edge rules</a>.</p>

<p>After you create your service, you enter restriction rules in the <strong>Restrictions</strong> section of the CDN service page.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong>: A name for the rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong>: <strong>Referrer</strong>, <strong>Geography</strong>, and <strong>Client IP</strong> address are the restriction types currently supported. Choose one from the drop down menu.</li>
	<li><strong>Access</strong>: <strong>Access</strong> enables you to <strong>Allow</strong> or <strong>Block</strong> access to your content.</li>
	<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The domain that is allowed to access your edge node content. You can enter a URL with or without <strong>http://</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Path</strong>: Path for the rule. Path defines which content enforces your restriction. To apply the restriction to your entire site, use the path "/*"</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can add multiple <strong>Referrer</strong> domains that use the same <strong>Path</strong> by separating the list of domains with a space, as shown in the following example.<br />
