<p>Previously, if billing for your account failed, a message would be displayed when you logged in to the Cloud Sites Control Panel. The message stated that there was an issue billing your account and to contact our Cloud Billing team. This notification method has changed, as follows.</p>

<p>If the credit card on file for your account is declined, an email is sent to the billing email address on file.&nbsp;If you receive such an email, contact the Cloud AR team at US toll free 800-480-2716, and international 1-210-312-4000. Do not contact the Cloud Billing team.</p>

<p>To see any outstanding balances for your account, perform the follow steps:</p>

<div class="printfooter">
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>In the upper-right corner of the window, click&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong><strong>: <em>userName</em> &gt;</strong> <strong>Billing and Payments</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
	The Billing &amp; Payments page appears.<br />
	<strong>Note:</strong> Clicking&nbsp;<strong>Your Account</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Billing&nbsp;</strong>in the Cloud Sites Control Panel also opens this page in the Cloud Control Panel.</li>
	<li>Review any balances listed under&nbsp;<strong>Current Balance</strong>.<br />
	A total is displayed if any balance is due.</li>
	<li>Contact the Cloud AR team (not the Cloud Billing team) at US toll free 800-480-2716 and&nbsp;international 1-210-312-4000&nbsp;to discuss any balances that are due.</li>
</ol>
</div>
