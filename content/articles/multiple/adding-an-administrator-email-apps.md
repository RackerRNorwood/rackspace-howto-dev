        the **Domain Access**tab.
    3.  Use the **Filter** and **Search** tools to locate the domains
        associated with the account.
    4.  In the **Current Domain**s box, select the domain or domains
        that you want to allow the administrator to access. To select
        multiple domains, hold the Ctrl key as you click each domain.

9.  Click Save.

You can email your newly created administrator with the credentials to
log in.

 

Delete an administrator
-----------------------

Deleting an administrator completely removes the admin user from the
control panel.  If access needs to be granted again, a different Super
Administrator must re-create the user.

To delete an administrator, [log in to the control
panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/), and perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Office control
    panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2.  At the top of the page, click **My Account**.
3.  In the **Administrators** section, click **Administrators**.
4.  Select the check box next to each administrator that you want to
    delete. If you delete the logged in administrator, you will be
    logged out upon deletion. The account must have at least one
    administrator.
5.  Click **Delete**.
6.  In the confirmation box, click **OK**.

Disable Administrator
---------------------

Disabling administrators removes their ability to log in to the control
panel, but it keeps their information visible so that they can be
re-enabled in the future.

To disable an administrator, [log in to the control
panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/), and perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Office control
    panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/),
2.  At the top of the page, click **My Account.**
3.  In the **Administrators** section, click **Administrators**.
4.  In the **Action** column for the administrator, click **Disable**. \
     **Note**: You can reverse this action by clicking **Enable.**
5.  In the confirmation pop-up box, click **Delete \# Administrator**.
    (The **\#** corresponds to the number of administrators that you
    have selected for deletion.)
