<p>Adding impersonation to your site&nbsp;allows the web server process to run as your primary File Transfer Protocol (FTP) user. This means that it has permission to write to your files, create files, create folders, and perform other activities that would normally require full read, write, and execute permissions.</p>

<p>The following steps work only on ASP.NET through a <strong>web.config</strong> file. If you are not sure what data center your site is deployed in, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/715">Rackspace data centers and regions</a>. Use your Rackspace Cloud account username and password, where indicated by &lt;username&gt; and &lt;password&gt; in the following command.</p>

<p>For customers whose sites are deployed in our DFW data center, add the following lines to your <strong>web.config</strong> file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;identity impersonate="true" userName="dfw\USERNAME" password="PASSWORD" /&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>

<p>For customers whose sites are deployed&nbsp;in our ORD data center, add the following lines to your <strong>web.config</strong> file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;identity impersonate="true" userName="ord\USERNAME" password="PASSWORD" /&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>You <em>must</em> use the user name that is configured to be the primary FTP account for the cloud site that you are working with. If the site was created under your main account, the credentials are your main control panel login credentials. If the site was created under a client, use the client's main account credentials. When in doubt, you can go to the <strong>Security</strong> tab for a cloud site to confirm the primary FTP account.</p>

<p>After you make this change, you need to rebuild the application. For instructions, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/659">Rebuild an ASP.NET application in Cloud Sites</a>.</p>
