<p>An application pool is a form of encapsulation to prevent the effects of bad code being executing from impacting other processes. Each application pool has its own worker process associated with it. By default, each site's /content directory is an application pool. In some situations, you may have installed a separate application into a sub-directory, such as /content/gallery. In this case, you may need to have the /gallery sub-directory turned into an application pool. By contacting support, this can be processed for you.</p><p>For in-depth information concerning application pools, please see the following article:</p><p><a href="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/2245511" title="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/2245511" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/2245511</a></p>
