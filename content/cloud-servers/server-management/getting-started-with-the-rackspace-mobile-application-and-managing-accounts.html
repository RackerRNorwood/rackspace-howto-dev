<p>Now that you are familiar with the Control Panel and know&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-essentials-1-getting-fanatical-support">how to get Fanatical Support</a>&nbsp;through all of our available channels, let's introduce you to an alternative method to using the Cloud Control Panel. The Rackspace mobile applications provide a seamless&nbsp;way&nbsp;for customers to access, create, and manage Cloud Servers across the Rackspace Cloud. Specifically, you will be able to create, rename, reboot, and rebuild servers; check response times across&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;data centers; look up the Rackspace Cloud System Status; and contact Rackspace Fanatical Support across all regions.</p>

<h3 id="GettingStartedwiththeRackspaceMobileApplication-GettingStartedwiththeRackspaceiOSApplicationandManagingAccounts">Download the Application</h3>

<p>Download the Rackspace mobile application appropriate for your mobile device:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rackspace.cloudmobile">Android application</a> from the Google Play Store</li>
	<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rackspace-cloud-control/id672443103?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS application</a> from the Apple App Store</li>
	<li><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/rackspace-cloud/fba5a14e-2ca2-4137-864f-31e40ba84e10" target="_blank">Windows 8</a> application from the Microsoft Apps store</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Once you have installed the Rackspace application on your mobile device, you are ready to get started with managing Cloud Servers on your account!</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you arrive at the log-in screen, enter in your user credentials. These will be the same Username and Password you use to access the Control Panel</li>
	<li>Tap "Log In" and you will be logged into your Rackspace account and taken to view the Server List page</li>
	<li>To add more Rackspace accounts to the application, tap on the menu icon in the top left corner of the screen and select Accounts from the menu drawer</li>
	<li>Tap the "+" icon in the top right to add another account. Once the Authentication screen appears, add in the login credentials for the additional account. Again, this will match the Username and Password used to log into the account on the Cloud Control Panel.</li>
</ul>
