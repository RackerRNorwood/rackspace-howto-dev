For any domain that is registered with or transferred to The Rackspace
Cloud, we will automatically notify you as the expiration date for your
domain name nears. The notices will be sent to the email address listed
under the administrative contact for that particular domain name.

A total of three email notices will be sent to you, beginning 90 days
before your domain is set to expire, and a fourth notice will be sent
out 10 days after the expiration date. If you do not renew before the
stated expiration date, the domain name will be held in reserve for a
redemption period of 45 days. During this redemption period, you may
incur a registry-imposed redemption fee in order to reactivate your
domain. To renew or redeem your domain name, please contact [customer
support](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do "http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do").
