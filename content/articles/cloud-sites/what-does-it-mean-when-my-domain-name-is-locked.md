A "locked" domain cannot be transferred to a new registrar. Your current
registrar may offer "transfer lock" or a similar service as a security
measure to prevent unauthorized transfer of your domain name. If this
feature is activated, you will need to log on to your account with your
current registrar and turn this feature off before you can transfer your
domain name.
