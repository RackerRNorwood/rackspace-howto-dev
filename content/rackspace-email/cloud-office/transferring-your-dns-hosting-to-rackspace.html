<p>Rackspace allows you to manage your DNS through our control panel while allowing you to&nbsp;keep your domain with your current hosting provider. Let's take a look at the following steps:<br /><br /> <em>Note: There is an annual fee of $5 for the service.</em><br /><br /></p><h2>Transferring Your DNS Hosting To Rackspace</h2><p>1. First thing you'll want to do is contact our support team and request the <strong>DNS Hosting</strong> service for your domain. At this time, we will automatically set up your DNS according to your current DNS settings, so that you will not experience any interruption of service.</p><p>2. Next, you will then need to contact your Domain Registrar and ask them to change your <strong>Name Servers</strong> and point them to the following:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Primary</strong>:</td><td>DNS1.NAME-SERVICES.COM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Secondary</strong>:</td><td>DNS2.NAME-SERVICES.COM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Secondary</strong>:</td><td>DNS3.NAME-SERVICES.COM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Secondary</strong>:</td><td>DNS4.NAME-SERVICES.COM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Secondary</strong>:</td><td>DNS5.NAME-SERVICES.COM</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Note:</em> <em>DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to resolve. We recommend that you make this switch during non-business hours or when email activity is light. No email will be lost during this transition, but do not cancel your current DNS hosting service until the transfer is complete.</em></p>
