You can recover the password for your Rackspace Email account by having
our system send your phone a text message verifying your identity. This
feature must be enabled by your site administrator, and you'll need to
enter a mobile phone number for your account before it will work.

Rackspace will only use your phone number for security verification
purposes. We will never sell or share it.

Below are some frequently asked questions and answers about this
feature.

How do I change my Rackspace Email password if I&rsquo;ve forgotten it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On your Webmail login page, click the **Forgot Password** link to change
your password. A one-time passcode will be sent in a text message to the
mobile phone number on file for your account.<br>

Why is Webmail asking for my mobile phone number?
-------------------------------------------------

Webmail prompts you periodically to provide an up-to-date mobile phone
number. Providing an up-to-date mobile phone number gives you access to
a self-service password recovery feature, in case you ever forget your
password.

How will my mobile phone number be used?
----------------------------------------

Your number is used only for account security purposes such as password
recovery.

Will you share my phone number with third parties?
--------------------------------------------------

The mobile phone number that you provide in Webmail will never be sold
to advertisers or other third parties. We might disclose your phone
number if it is reasonably necessary to comply with the law.
