Service books determine which services are available on your BlackBerr&reg;
device.  At times, the service books become corrupt and will cause the
Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) to fail upon synchronizing updates of
PIM data such as Calendar or Address Book entries. These issues are
frequently resolved by deleting and resending the service books to the
device.  Please have the user delete all service books starting with the&ldquo;Deskto&rdquo; from their Blackberry device. Once completed, resend the
service books from your Cloud Office control panel.

To delete the service books from the Blackberry take the following
steps:
