<p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation/index.php" target="_self">Colocation</a> typically describes the provisioning of space for IT infrastructure and equipment on a service provider's premises. Business who choose colocation often do so to maintain the control of their operating systems but still have a need for the physical space in which to house their infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Traditional Colocation: The Basics</strong> &nbsp; In a traditional colocation scenario, the vendor supplies: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Physical space (floor space-cabinets or cages)</li>
	<li>Power to the cabinet/cages (conditioned power, battery backup, and backup power generators)</li>
	<li>Adequate cooling and redundancy</li>
	<li>Security (video surveillance, guard-monitored floor, and locked space)</li>
	<li>Fire suppression</li>
	<li>Network Connection (some only allow for a set list of providers)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It should be noted that top tier colocation vendors also have options for additional services. (i.e, inventory space, access to multiple network providers, remote hand options). &nbsp; In traditional colocation, the customer also has a fair share of the responsibility. This includes: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Procurement of the IT infrastructure, including receiving and installation via hardware reseller or vendor (Cisco, HP, Dell, etc.)</li>
	<li>Procurement of the network connectivity and installation into the cabinet or cage</li>
	<li>Monitoring of all systems 24x7x365</li>
	<li>Supporting, maintenance and replacement of all devices 24x7x365</li>
	<li>Planning and scaling the configuration when appropriate</li>
	<li>Management of staff and multiple vendors (colocation center, hardware provider, network provider)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to consider the hidden costs and non-operational activities in a traditional colocation scenario:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Employee resources (management of staff dedicated to the hosting infrastructure; insurance; weekend, evening/overnight and holiday coverage; certifications and ongoing training)</li>
	<li>Management of vendor relationships</li>
	<li>Response to natural disasters</li>
	<li>Security and compliance requirements (SAS-70, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)</li>
	<li>Maintenance of depreciating assets</li>
	<li>Large capital expenditures with growth of business</li>
	<li>Slow implementation times</li>
</ul>
