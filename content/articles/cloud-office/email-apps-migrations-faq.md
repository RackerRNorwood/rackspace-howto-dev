What types of environments can you migrate from?
------------------------------------------------

We support migrations from Exchange Server 2003/2007/2010 (in-house and
hosted), Google Apps/Gmail, GroupWise 7/8, Zimbra, Lotus Notes, POP, and
IMAP

We have slow bandwidth and a slow in-house server.  Will your migration tool work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  We have highly experienced Rackers who have helped customers
migrate from a variety of environments. If the migration speed does not
meet your expectations, we can also migrate via pst files using FTP for
Exchange mailboxes.

How much does a migration to Rackspace cost?
--------------------------------------------

Both Self- service migration and Assisted Migration are free of charge.

How long does it take to migrate my servers to Rackspace?
---------------------------------------------------------

Migration times vary per customer.  Some migrate in hours and others
migrate in days or weeks.  The migration process is a partnership
between you and the migration team. Please consider your availability
and resources when planning your migration as they will be needed for
the testing phase of the migration and will impact the overall timeline
of the transition.

Is the migration manual or is it automated?
-------------------------------------------

We use a combination of automated tools and experienced Rackers to
perform the migration. At each step of the migration, we stay in close
contact with your team to help you get a successful outcome.

What server information do you need for the migration?
------------------------------------------------------

Once you submit your migration request, our email migration experts will
discuss available approaches with you, depending on the configuration of
your source server and your migration type.  Our team will require that
you provide the source server address/URL and all usernames and
passwords for the mailboxes.  A spreadsheet will be sent to you for this
step in the process. 

Can my users access their mail and other data during the migration?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, users can continue to access and use their mailbox normally.
However, we strongly recommend that passwords not be reset during the
migration.

What types of email data will be migrated?
------------------------------------------

Please see the article for [Items migrated during a Cloud Office
migration](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/items-migrated-during-an-cloud-office-migration).

Can I change from Rackspace Email to Exchange or vice versa?
------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, this process is referred to as a &ldquo;Platform Change&rdquo; which our
Internal Migration team will perform for you at no cost. You may place a
request by contacting our support team through one of the following
methods:

1.  Chat - via the [Cloud Office Control
    Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/)
2.  Ticket - via the [Cloud Office Control
    Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/)

Does the Migration Tool create mailboxes on my account or will I need to create the mailboxes first?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool will not create the mailboxes. They will need to be created in
the Control Panel prior to the migration. It will only migrate data to
existing mailboxes on your account.

What if my question was not answered in this FAQ?
-------------------------------------------------

Our Support Team who is available 24/7/365 will be happy to answer any
specific questions you may have.
