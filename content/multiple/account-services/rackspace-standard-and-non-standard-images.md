<p>The <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos" target="_blank">Rackspace Cloud Terms of Service</a> refer to standard and non-standard images. &nbsp;This article provides more detail about those terms.</p>

<h2>Standard Images</h2>

<p>Standard images are all the base images supplied by Rackspace for your service level and RackConnect status that have not yet reached end of life status.</p>

<h2>Non-Standard Images</h2>

<p>Any images that are not standard for your account's service level and RackConnect status are non-standard. The following images are considered non-standard images. Note that this list is not exhaustive.</p>

<ul>
	<li>All imported and exported images</li>
	<li>All end of life Images</li>
	<li>Any shared images that you receive</li>
	<li>The boot.rackspace.com image and any customer-created images derived from it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Support for Non-Standard Images</h2>

<p>Any non-standard images are subject to Rackspace's Managed Infrastructure policies. Please see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/service-levels/" title="Explanation of Rackspace service levels">http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/service-levels/</a>&nbsp;for an explanation of Rackspace service levels.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>Although there is no separate fee for using Cloud Images, you will incur indirect costs for underlying services that you use.</p>

<h2>How Can I Determine if an Image is Standard or Non-Standard?</h2>
