On the Preferences screen, you can determine how Cloud Backup notifies
you about Backup activity on your Account.

**Wait, didn't I do this already?**\
 When you created your Backups, you determined how Cloud Backup would
inform you about that Single Backup's activity. On the Preferences page,
you determine how you get emailed about all the activity on your
account: Daily, Weekly, or Both.

1.  Select frequency of emails:
    -   **Weekly Notifications** - Check the box next to "Send a weekly
        summary by email of all backups and restores"
    -   **Daily Notifications** - Check the box next to "Send a daily
        summary by email of all backups and restores"

2.  Enter your email address.
3.  Click the **Save Preferences** button.
