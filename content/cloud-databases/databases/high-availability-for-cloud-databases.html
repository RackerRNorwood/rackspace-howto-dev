<p>High Availability for Cloud Databases means that Cloud Databases users can run their critical production workloads without worrying about the database becoming unavailable. It improves the reliability of running a database in the cloud environment by minimizing downtime and ensuring that the application is never down for more than a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>A Cloud Databases High Availability (HA) instance group includes a source database instance with one or two replicas. For a true HA setup, we recommend that you have two replicas. In the future, we will increase the limit on the maximum number of replicas. There is no design limitation for the maximum number of replicas. If the source database instance becomes unavailable, an automatic failover is initiated to one of the replicas. The automatic failover and promotion of the new replica is completed within a short downtime (approximately 10-30 seconds).</p>

<p>Currently, HA is supported for MySQL 5.6, Percona 5.6, and MariaDB 10.</p>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<ul>
	<li>For critical application workloads, a couple of minutes of application downtime can result in huge revenue losses. Users can use Cloud Databases HA instances to ensure that their database is always available and will only experience a small amount of downtime in case of failover.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For read-heavy workloads, to improve performance Cloud Databases users can redirect writes and reads to source and replica instances (within the HA setup) respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The user’s application must be able to direct the reads and writes to a specific endpoint.</p>

<h2>Technical/architecture details</h2>

<p>HA for Cloud Databases relies on the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-ha/">MHA for MySQL</a> functionality for source monitoring, automatic failover, and replica promotion. The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-semisync.html">replication setup is semi-synchronous</a> and is set up using GTIDs (for MySQL 5.6, Percona 5.6, and without GTID for MariaDB 10) between one source and one or two replicas. To improve the robustness of the system, the source and replicas are provisioned on separate hosts.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy load balancer</a> is used to control a single access point (IP/hostname) for the HA group and uses a different port for a read-write pool (port 3306) and read-only pool (port 3307). The load balancer with HAProxy is highly available itself, with two nodes managed by <a href="http://keepalived.org/">Keepalived</a> and is accessed using a VIP (virtual IP). Figure 1 gives an overview of a Cloud Database HA setup.</p>

<p>The MHA manager lives within the master HAProxy node and monitors the source database instance. If the source database instance becomes unavailable, MHA initiates failover to the most up-to-date replica node. All other replica nodes automatically re-attach themselves to the new source. If some of the replicas have not received the latest relay log events, MHA automatically identifies differential relay log events from the latest replica and applies them to the other replicas. MHA also triggers a script that switches the new source out of the read-only pool and updates the write pool. Total downtime is around 10-30 seconds.</p>

<h2>Getting started with HA for Cloud Databases</h2>

<p>Creation of new HA instance groups is currently available in the Cloud Control Panel and API, but conversion of running instances to HA is still API only. The ability to convert instances to HA will be added to the Cloud Control Panel in an upcoming release. For more details about the HA-related API calls, see the API documentation at <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-devguide/content/ha.html">http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-devguide/content/ha.html</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>By default, access is blocked for an HA instance. To access an HA instance, you must explicitly add an ACL that specifies the IP address to grant access for.</li>
	<li>The <code>networks</code> property associated with an HA instance (obtained by listing the details of an HA instance) provides details about accessing the HA instance. The single access point (VIP) of the HA instance is specified as the <code>address</code>. All the reads and writes are directed to this single access point and port 3306 (source database). You can also point reads to replicas using port 3307.</li>
	<li>The only allowed operations on instances that are part of the HA group are Create users and Create databases (on source only). All other operations are blocked on these instances.</li>
	<li>In case a failover occurs, there will be an automatic failover to the replica closest to the failed database instance. Cloud Databases will remove the failed database instance. A new replica of the same flavor and volume as the other instances that are part of the HA group will be built and automatically added to this setup in order to maintain the HA node configuration. For the period when this replica is being added, the HA would be in <code>ADDING_REPLICA</code> state and would switch to <code>ACTIVE</code> once the node has been successfully added.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Warning!</strong> Automatically adding a new replica node would restart the MHA manager service (which monitors the source/replica instances to trigger failover) and the haproxy service on the load balancer nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Create an HA setup with two replicas, which guarantees a highly available setup even post failover.</li>
	<li>Monitor and set up alarms for the replicas to ensure that they are in a healthy state. For more information about monitoring replicas, see the <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-devguide/content/Monitoring_Read_Replication-d1e3694.html">API documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Currently, the maximum number of replicas allowed per source database instance is two.</li>
	<li>An HA instance is available only for instance flavors 1 GB and greater.</li>
	<li>The source and replicas should have the same size and flavor.</li>
	<li>The source and replicas are created in the same region.</li>
	<li>Currently backups, resizes, and custom configurations cannot be performed for instances that are part of the HA setup. Backups and incremental backups can be created for the HA group. Resizes (both volume and flavor) can be performed across the HA cluster. Custom configurations for the HA cluster will be supported soon.</li>
	<li>There will be a small delay between the source and the replicas.</li>
	<li>The HA setup might take anywhere between 5-10 minutes, depending on the number of replicas. Because it requires creation of multiple nodes, allow some time for the HA instance’s <code>status</code> property to display as ACTIVE when performing a GET in the API.</li>
</ul>
