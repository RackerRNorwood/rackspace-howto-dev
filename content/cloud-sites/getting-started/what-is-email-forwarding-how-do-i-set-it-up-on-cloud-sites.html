<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Email is no longer offered as a feature for Cloud Sites. This article exists to support customers with legacy email accounts.</p>

<p>Email forwarding enables you to automatically send all of the emails received at a configured email account to one or more email addresses.</p>

<p>You may set up a total of 15 email forwards. Of the 15 forwarding addresses, a maximum of 4 of them can be on an external domain (a domain other than that on which the email is configured). These entries must be separated by commas.</p>

<h2>To set up an email forward for one of your email accounts</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left navigation pane, click <strong>Hosting &gt; Cloud Sites</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the Cloud Site domain name that contains the email account to which you want to add the email forwards.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Email accounts</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Select the email account from the list.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the page, enter the email address you want to forward to in the <strong>Forwarding Address</strong> field (multiple entries <em>must</em> be separated by commas).</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
	It might take up to 15 minutes for the changes to the mail account to become effective.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the email forward has taken effect, email will no longer arrive at this mailbox. It will be immediately sent to the forward addresses.</p>

<h2>To have the mail server retain a copy of the message</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to webmail (<a href="http://webmail.emailsrvr.com/" title="http://webmail.emailsrvr.com">http://webmail.emailsrvr.com</a>) for the email address that has the forwarding addresses applied to it.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> link in the top-right corner.</li>
	<li>On the left menu, click the <strong>Incoming Email</strong> link.</li>
	<li>Under the <strong>Forwarding</strong> tab, check the <strong>Save a copy of forwarded email</strong> check box.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
	Again, allow up to 15 minutes for these changes to take effect.</li>
</ol>
