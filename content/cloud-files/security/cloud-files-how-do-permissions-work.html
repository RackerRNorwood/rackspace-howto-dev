<p>There are no permissions or access controls around containers or objects other than being split into separate accounts. Users must authenticate with a valid user name and API Access Key, but once authenticated, they can create or delete containers and objects only within that account.</p><p>At this time, there is no way to publicly access the objects stored in Cloud Files unless that container is published to CDN. Each request to Cloud Files must include a valid "storage token" in an HTTP header transmitted over a HTTPS connection.</p>
