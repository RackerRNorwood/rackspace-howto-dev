Rackspace Intelligence monitors the performance and availability of
infrastructure and, when limits are exceeded, can respond by [notifying
someone](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-rackspace-intelligence-notification-plans) or
by [suppressing
notification](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/scheduling-suppression-of-rackspace-intelligence-notifications).

When you [log in to Rackspace
Intelligence](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-into-the-rackspace-intelligence-dashboard),
you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:

The dashboard provides a main overview of all of your monitoring
activities.

You can also examine different aspects of how Rackspace Intelligence is
configured to monitor your system by accessing the following sections
from the header:

-   Monitor
-   Suppress
-   Notify
-   Visualize

Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the
offerings in that section. For example, in the Monitor section, you can
choose to work
with [entities](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence) or [open
alerts](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-open-alerts-with-rackspace-intelligence).

In some areas of the interface, an **Actions** menu is available. For
example, if you [create an
entity](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence#create-entities)
in the Monitor section and provide basic information about it, the
entity details page contains an **Actions** menu. You can use the
commands on the menu to rename the entity, define an IP address for the
entity, delete the entity, and create checks or suppressions for the
entity.

By understanding the structure of these sections in the Rackspace
Intelligence interface, you can predict where to find the information
and tools that you need.

can perform functions similar to those available with Cloud
Monitoring.](/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/intelligence-ui-461x597.png)
