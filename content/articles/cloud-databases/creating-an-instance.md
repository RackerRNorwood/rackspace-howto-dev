Quick Facts
-----------

Here are some important facts to consider when creating a new instance:

-   The length of the instance name is limited to 255 characters and any
    characters are permitted.
-   You can create a database instance with one or more databases.
    Databases and users can be configured when you create the instance
    or at a later time.
-   Each database can have an unlimited number of users associated with
    it.
-   The default binding for the MySQL instance is port 3306.

### Accessibility

For enhanced security, database instances are directly accessible on the
internal Rackspace Network and by using a Cloud resource within the same
regional data center. For example, a database instance in DFW can only
be accessed by a Cloud Server in DFW. For more information, see [Public
Vs. Private
Access](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/public-and-private-access-for-cloud-databases)
and [Connecting to Your
Database](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/connect-to-a-cloud-databases-instance).
