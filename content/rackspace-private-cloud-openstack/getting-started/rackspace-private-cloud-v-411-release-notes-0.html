For the full list of known issues and information from the Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.0 release, refer to the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-v-40-release-notes">Rackspace Private Cloud v. 4.0 Release Notes</a>. <a href="/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-v-40-release-notes#known-cinder-centOS">A new known issue has been identified in this release relating to snapshot deletion in CentOS</a>.</p>
<p class="link" title="Cookbook Changes">Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.1.2 has the following changes.</p>
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="cookbook-download-4.1"></a>Cookbook Changes</h2>
<p>The following changes have been made to the Rackspace Private Cloud cookbooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest cookbook version number is <code class="filename">v4.1.2</code>. This change is reflected in the instructions under <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#install-cookbooks" target="_top">Install the Rackspace Private Cloud Cookbooks</a>.</li>
<li>The override attributes for defining nova-network have changed. This change is reflected in the instructions under <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#define-override-attrs" target="_top">Define Network Attributes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CentOS 6.4 Support</h2>
<p>Rackspace Private Cloud can now be installed on CentOS 6.4.</p>
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="HA-VIPs-4.1"></a>Changes in HA VIP Attributes</h2>
<p>A new configuration block must be used in <code class="filename">override_attributes</code> to define the virtual router ID and network for the VIPs. Refer to <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#nova-cluster-ha" target="_top">Controller Node High Availability</a> for detailed information about this configuration.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading your environment from an older configuration in which VIP vrid and networks were not defined, you may have to remove the keepalived configurations in <code class="filename">/etc/keepalived/conf.d/*</code> and run chef-client before adding the VIP vrid and network definitions to override_attributes.</p>
<h2>OpenStack Networking HA</h2>
<p>OpenStack Networking has been made HA as of Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.1.2, and has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6.4. For an HA configuration, you must configure the OpenStack networking roles on the Controller node. Do not use a standalone Network node if you require OpenStack Networking to be HA.</p>
<h2>OpenStack Networking Support on CentOS</h2>
<p>Rackspace Private Cloud can now be used to implement OpenStack Networking on devices running CentOS 6.4. After applying the <code>single-network-node</code> role to the device, you must reboot it to use the appropriate version of the CentOS 6.4 kernel.</p>
<h2><a name="rabbitmq-4.1.1"></a>RabbitMQ Clustering</h2>
<p>Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.1.2 builds out clustered RabbitMQ by default. Fresh installations with v 4.1.2 include this feature automatically, but installations created with Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.0.0 cookbooks will have to be upgraded with the procedure documented in <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/upgrading-your-private-cloud#upgrade-rabbitmq-v41" target="_top">Upgrading Your Private Cloud</a>.</p>
