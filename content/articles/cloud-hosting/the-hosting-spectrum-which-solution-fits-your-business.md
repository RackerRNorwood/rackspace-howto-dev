or night. A
[colocation](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation/index.php)
strategy requires that the customer select a vendor with a data center
located within a reasonable distance from the IT staff, as any issues
with devices, operating systems, application infrastructure, and
applications must be handled by the staff.  

 

**Managed Colocation**

In Managed Colocation, the provider offers the datacenter space,
network, servers and other devices. The customer retains full control
and administrative responsibility over the hosting environment
(operating system and applications). This scenario creates shared
responsibility. With the hosting provider managing the hardware, network
and power, the responsibility of the operating system and application
lies with the customer's staff. [Managed
Colocation](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation/index.php)
provides the desired level of control that businesses get with
traditional colocation, but removes the day-to-day management of servers
and network devices.  

 

**Managed Hosting**

In a [Managed
Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/index.php)
environment, the provider owns and is responsible for the data center,
network, device (i.e. servers, load balancers, firewalls, etc.),
virtualization, OS and application infrastructure (i.e. web servers,
application servers, database servers) of the IT infrastructure,
providing a stable operating environment for the business's
applications. The IT staff manages the business applications and has
full control over the operating system and application infrastructure.
The customer retains control of their software and applications. Managed
Hosting provides more support compared to the previous hosting options
and allows businesses to focus fully on their core mission.  

 

**Outsource**

 

The provider has complete ownership of the IT management stack,
including the data center, network, devices,
[virtualization](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/private_cloud/index.php)
software, operating systems, application infrastructure and
applications. Fully outsourced solution providers offer service level
agreements (SLAs) promising specified levels of application availability
and as a result they restrict their clients from having any
administrative access to their environment, including their application.
This means that any changes to the application infrastructure or the
application itself must be approved by the vendor and implemented
according to their timetable.
