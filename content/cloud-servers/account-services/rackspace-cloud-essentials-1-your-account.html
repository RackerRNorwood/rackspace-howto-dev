<p>This article provides a closer look at the services available on the&nbsp;<strong>Account Settings</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>User Management</strong>&nbsp;pages in the Cloud Control Panel. You access these pages from the <strong>Account</strong> menu located in the top-right corner of the control panel.</p>

<h2>Account Settings page</h2>

<p>Use the Account Settings page to view or adjust login details, contact information for the primary contact on your account, and time zone preferences.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the <strong>Login Details</strong>&nbsp;section to update your password, email address, or security question. Your username is set at the time that you create your account and cannot be changed. To use a different username, you must close the account and create a new one. Each account has only one username, and there are no subaccounts. If you have multiple team members who need to access the Rackspace Cloud account, you must add each one as a member on the <a href="#usermanagement"><strong>User Management</strong> page</a>.<br />
	Your&nbsp;API key&nbsp;is a unique alphanumeric identifier associated with your account. You can use the API key to manage your assets through a scripting interface. You can view , copy, or&nbsp;reset&nbsp;your API key in the&nbsp;<strong>Login Details </strong>section.</li>
	<li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Contact Information</strong>&nbsp;section, pay special attention to the information that you have set for the&nbsp;primary contact. The primary contact is the person who is authorized to make service requests, and the specified email address is the only one that is contacted when a service-impacting event occurs. Ensure that the address for the primary contact is set up to receive critical information and is monitored 24 hours a day.</li>
	<li>Select your local time zone in the&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong>&nbsp;section.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="usermanagement" name="usermanagement"></a>User Management page</h2>

<p>Use the&nbsp;<strong>User Management</strong>&nbsp;page to edit user-related information, such as email addresses and passwords, and to add new users.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To make changes for a user, click the gear icon next the user name and select&nbsp;<strong>Edit Email Address</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Change Password</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Edit Security Question</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Edit Contact information</strong>. Complete the applicable fields in the resulting popup dialog box and save the changess.</li>
	<li>To add a new user, click&nbsp;<strong>Create User</strong>. On the&nbsp;<strong>Create User</strong>&nbsp;page, enter information for the new userâ€™s login, access levels, and contact information. For information about access controls for your new users, see&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/overview-role-based-access-control-rbac">Overview: Role Based Access Control (RBAC).</a> After you have entered all of the information for the new user, click the <strong>Create User</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</li>
