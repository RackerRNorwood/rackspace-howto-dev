<p>Creating a support ticket in your <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a> is the best way to communicate with Rackspace Support Technicians. Following are the two ways through which you can create a ticket:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After you are logged in, click on the&nbsp;<strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;button in the top navigation bar and select&nbsp;<strong>Create or View a Ticket</strong>&nbsp;in the pop-up window.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/control-panel-support-options.png" style="width: 600px; height: 453px;" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Click on your&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong>&nbsp;in the top navigation bar, and in the drop-down menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Support Tickets</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" height="279" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/control-panel-drop-down-support.png" width="250" /></p>

<p><span>When you click on the <strong>Support&nbsp;</strong><strong>Tickets</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>Create or View a Ticket</strong>&nbsp;link, you will see a list displaying your currently open tickets, and a tab with the option to view your closed tickets. Each ticket entry displays the name, the date it was last updated, the ticket status, and ticket ID number. To create a new ticket, click on the&nbsp;<strong>Create Ticket</strong>&nbsp;button.</span></p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/control-panel-support-tickets.png" style="width: 600px; height: 272px;" /></p>

<p>When you create a new ticket, you can select a broad product&nbsp;category, such as Cloud Servers, Cloud Sites, or Cloud Databases, and then a more specific category that narrows down the type of problem you are experiencing, such as General Support, or API. In the&nbsp;<strong>Details</strong>&nbsp;section, enter a subject and message describing your issue. You can also attach a file up to 20 MB to the ticket. After you have entered information into all the fields, click&nbsp;<strong>Submit Ticket</strong>.</p>

<p>The best way to communicate with our Support Technicians and provide specific details about a problem that you are experiencing is by opening a ticket. &nbsp;The advantage of using a ticket is that it allows you to copy &amp; paste or attach cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log entries directly into the ticket.&nbsp;</p>
