<h3>Cloud Sites: &nbsp;.NET 4.5 Now Available</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rackspace Cloud Sites now offers .NET version 4.5. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the changes, benefits, and features of .NET 4.5 here -&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868.aspx</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">.NET 4.0 is still available in the Cloud Sites Control Panel as a technology option.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If your websites are currently .NET 4.5-compatible we recommend that you perform the .NET 4.5 upgrade. Customers can upgrade to .NET 4.5 by selecting the .NET 4.5 technology option from the Features page of the control panel. This migration is a very easy process. Please follow these simple steps:</p>

<p>First, please ensure that your applications or CMS solutions are running the latest .NET 4.5-compatible version prior to upgrading from .NET 4.0 to .NET 4.5. Most CMS solutions have an automatic upgrade process and should be compatible with .NET 4.5 (if you are unsure, please check with your CMS vendor).</p>

<p>In your Cloud Sites Control Panel, navigate to <strong>Hosting</strong> &gt; <strong>Cloud Sites</strong>&nbsp;and click on your site. &nbsp;Next select the <strong>Features</strong> tab and click on the <strong>Change Technology</strong> button.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="" height="287" src="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Selection_001_0.png" title="" width="702" /></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Next select the appropriate .NET 4.5 option and click <strong>Change Technology</strong>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="" height="137" src="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Selection_003_0.png" title="" width="694" /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Your Site may take up to 2 minutes to migrate to the new .NET 4.5 cluster. &nbsp;Repeat this process for each site that you host that is running .NET 4.0.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Please Note</strong>: changing the default technology from .NET 4.0 to .NET 4.5 will change the site’s IP address. If you are managing your DNS with Rackspace Cloud (your site is pointing to our nameservers: dns1.stabletransit.com or dns2.stabletransit.com) your IP address will be automatically updated. If you are managing your own DNS (your site is not pointing to our nameservers) you will need to update your DNS to point the site to the new IP address.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">That’s it, you are now migrated to .NET 4.5 !</p>
