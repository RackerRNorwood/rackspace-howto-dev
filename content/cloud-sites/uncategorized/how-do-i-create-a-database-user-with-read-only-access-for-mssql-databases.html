<p>This article explains how to log in to MyLittleAdmin and use that tool to create additional database users that have limited access. You can specify a read-only user this way. You must create an additional user beforehand within the control panel of that database.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to MyLittleAdmin by using the credentials for the database.<br />
	For more information about logging in and the credentials that you need, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/538">Rackspace Cloud Essentials â€“ MyLittleAdmin Database Management Interface</a>.</li>
	<li>In the Databases section of the left navigation pane, expand <strong>User Databases</strong>.</li>
	<li>Expand your database name.</li>
	<li>Expand <strong>Security &gt; Roles &gt; Database Roles</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>db_datareader</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the corresponding user from the <strong>Owner</strong> menu.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternately, you can limit a user's access by selecting the type of roles that this user can perform. You can also provide this user in a connection string for better security.</p>
