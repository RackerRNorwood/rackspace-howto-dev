To protect the email service and ensure a timely and reliable experience
for customers, the Rackspace hosted email system limits the number of
email messages that users can send in a day. Daily limits are applied
over a rolling 24-hour period and restrict the total number of
recipients to which a user can send messages in this period.

Users are limited to 20,000 total recipients per 24-hour period.
Counting recipients is different than counting messages. For example,
sending 200 emails that each have 100 recipients is counted the same as
sending 20,000 emails that each have a single recipient.

Automated email and spam is restricted at much lower limits to protect
the integrity of the system. Rackspace reserves the right to change
these limits without warning or notice to ensure the integrity of the
email service.
