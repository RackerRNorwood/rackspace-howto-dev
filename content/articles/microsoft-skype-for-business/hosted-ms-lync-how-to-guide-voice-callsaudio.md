Set up your audio device {#RackerLyncHowtoGuide-Checkyouraudiodevice}
------------------------

Before you use Skype for Business to make or join an audio call, set up
your audio device and check the quality. You can use your compute&rsquo;s
microphone and speakers, or you can use a headset or earphones.

1.  In the lower-left corner of the Skype for Business main window,
    click the **Select Your Primary Device**icon, and select **Audio
    Device Settings** from the menu.\

2.  Click the **Select the device you want to use for audio**calls menu,
    and select the device that you want to use.\
      
3.  In the **Customize your device**section, drag the sliders to adjust
    the volumes of the speakers and microphone.
    -   To hear a sample tone, click the green arrow for the speaker.
    -   Adjust and test your microphone, using the blue indicator to
        help you choose the appropriate level. If you are using a
        handset, speak into the receiver. If you are using a headset,
        speak into the microphone.\
