<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> We no longer accept new sign-ups for Cloud Drive, though it is still supported for existing customers. New customers should use the <a href="https://jungledisk.com/">equivalent service offered via JungleDisk</a> instead.</em></p><p>Cloud Drive allows administrators to create Sub-Accounts for users within your group for sharing. After you've created your master account, you'll be prompted to create Sub-Accounts for users. Let's take a look at the article below to get you setup:</p><h3>Setting Up Sub-Accounts:</h3><p>1. First thing you'll do is login to your control panel at <a href="http://cp.rackspace.com">http://cp.rackspace.com</a>. Select <strong>Manage via Jungle Disk</strong>, and then select <strong>Sub-Account Management</strong> under Workgroup.</p><p><em>Note: If you're not allowed to create a Sub-Account, be sure that you've created your Master Account first.</em></p><p>2. Next, create a Username, Password, and Tags (optional) for your Sub-Account.</p><p><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://c715137.r37.cf2.rackcdn.com/eaGettingStartedCloudDrive6.png" alt="" /></p><p><em>Note: Tags are used to sort users in generated reports and are purely for informational purposes (e.g., Finance, CEO, HR).</em>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Select the following option you would like to apply to your Sub-Account.</p><p><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://c715137.r37.cf2.rackcdn.com/eaGettingStartedCloudDrive7.png" alt="" /></p><p><em>Note:</em> <em>If the Private Online Disk check box is selected, an online disk will be created for this user and they will automatically be granted access to this disk.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>4.
