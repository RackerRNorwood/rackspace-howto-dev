<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-9/6 Windows Managed Operations Cloud Server Snapshots Failing RackConnect</strong><br /><br />Description: Windows Managed Operations Cloud Server Snapshots fail RackConnect automation</p>
<p>Cause: The agent is not able to correctly set the private IP when IPv6 is disabled, leading to an instance that does not have proper connectivity and thus fails RackConnect automation.<br /><br />Affects: Snapshots created from next generation Managed Operations Windows Servers where the Cloud Server from which the image is based was spun up before 9/6/12<br /><br />Workaround: Re-enable IPv6 on the base image before creating snapshots. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852 for instructions.</p>
