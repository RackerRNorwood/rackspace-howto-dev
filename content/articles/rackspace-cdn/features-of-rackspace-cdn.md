undefined&rsquo;t get the brunt force traffic associated with a DDOS attack.
This means that your website can still serve good traffic while an
attack is occurring, keeping your visitors engaged at all times.

**Custom SSL**

Serving content over HTTPS is quickly becoming standard for websites and
applications. Rackspace CDN gives you multiple options for using your
own domain while serving over HTTPS, including Subject Name Alternative
(SAN) certificates and dedicated certificates.

**Access controls to protect content**

Rackspace CDN can help you control who sees your content by setting
access rules that are enforced on the edge nodes. Access rules can be
set by geography and referring domain, and they help prevent unwanted
linking and traffic from non-strategic regions.

**Multiple origins flexibility**

Rackspace offers you a full portfolio of public, dedicated, and private
managed cloud solutions for your workloads. Rackspace CDN can use any of
these resources as origins, with the flexibility to use multiple origins
with a single website or domain. You can even use Rackspace CDN with
origins not hosted at Rackspace.

**Dynamic visitor handling**

Rackspace CDN delivers both static and dynamic content. Dynamic content
that changes for every user or a set of users requires additional
handling at the edge nodes. Rackspace CDN enables you to set a TTL of
zero for noncacheable content, and supports dynamic content handling
features like cookies, header forwarding, and cross-origin resource
sharing (CORS).

**Keep your content up-to-date**

Rackspace CDN supports content time to live (TTL) values in seconds, all
the way down to zero. In addition, you can submit requests any time you
need to update content outside of the TTL timeframe.

**Granular control**

Rackspace CDN enables you to implement edge rules based on resource
path, meaning that your rules can apply to multiple levels of
granularity, from the entire site to a specific file.
