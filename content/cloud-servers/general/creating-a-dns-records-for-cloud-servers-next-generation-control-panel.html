<a id="B"></a>
<h3>Add a Domain</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Click <strong>Create Domain</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the popup dialog box, enter the following information:
        <ul>
               <li>Name of your domain.</li>
               <li>Email address publicly associated as the admin and contact for the domain.</li>
               <li>Time to live (TTL) for the domain.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Click <strong>Create Domain</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<a id="C"></a>
<h3>Add an A Record</h3>

<p>An A is an IPv4 address record that you use to point your domain to an IP address. It is also known as an A name.</p>

<ol>
<li>On the Cloud DNS page, click the gear icon next to your domain and select <strong>Add DNS Record</strong>.</li>
<li>In the popup dialog box, select <strong>A/AAAA Record</strong> for the record type.</li>
<li>Enter the following information:
<ul>
<li>The hostname for your domain (optional).</li>
<li>Target (IP address of the server).</li>
<li>Time to live (TTL). The TTL refers to the time it will take for your computer to refresh DNS information. It is referred to in seconds of time.</li>
</ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add Record</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<a id="D"></a>
<h3>Add a CNAME Record</h3>

<p>A CNAME record, also known as a canonical name record, is a record type in the DNS that you use to indicate that your domain name is an alias for your domain's canonical name. Subdomains and IP addresses for your domain are defined by the canonical domain.</p>

<p>Use the Common Name (CNAME) record to point to another record.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click the action gear next to your domain and click <strong>Add DNS Record</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>CNAME Record</strong> for the record type.</li>
       <ul>
             <li>The hostname for your domain (optional).</li>
             <li>Target (for your domain)</li>
             <li>Time to live (TTL). <li>The TTL refers to the time it will take for your computer to refresh DNS information. It is referred to in seconds of time.</li></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Click <strong> Add Record</strong></li>
</ol>

<a id="E"></a>
<h3>Add an MX Record</h3>

<p>Use the Mail Exchange (MX) is a DNS record that points to the server that handles your domain-related email delivery. You create an MX record for your domain that allows you to set up an email address. For example, you can create an MX record to create the email address <em>user@yourdomain.com</em. You can send email without setting up the MX record for your domain name, but you cannot receive emails without it.</p>

<ol>
<li>On the Cloud DNS page, click the gear icon next to your domain and select <strong>Add DNS Record</strong>.</li>
<li>In the popup dialog box, select <strong>MX Record</strong> for the record type.</li>
<li>Enter the following information:
<ul>
<li>The hostname for your domain (optional).</li>
<li>Domain of the mail server.</li>
<li>Priority. The MX record priority is a setting you will use when your domain name uses more than one mail server. The priority that you set for your MX record affects the load sharing and the order in which multiple mail servers are used, and also allows the use of primary and backup mail servers.</li>
<li>Time to live (TTL).  TTL refers to the time it will take for your computer to refresh DNS information. It is referred to in seconds of time.</li>
</ul>

<li>Click <strong>Add Record</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<a id="F"></a>
<h3>Delete a record from your domain</h3>

<ol>
<li>On the Cloud DNS page, click the name of the domain.</li>
<li>On the domain page, scroll down to the Records section, and choose one of the following methods to delete a record:
<ul>
<li>Select the check box next to the record that you want to delete, click Actions, and select Delete records. You can use this method to delete multiple records at once.
