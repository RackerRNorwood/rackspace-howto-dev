<p><strong>APPLIES TO:</strong> RackConnect v2.0, OnMetal Cloud Servers</p>
<p>Rackspace now supports OnMetal Cloud Servers with RackConnect. This means you can now enjoy the benefits of OnMetal Cloud Servers—single-tenant, bare-metal, API-driven—combined with the features of RackConnect—public IP address provisioning, network stack configuration, software firewall updates—to create your own custom hybrid solution that spans your dedicated, cloud, and OnMetal server environments.</p>
<p>If you are new to RackConnect or OnMetal, or would just like to learn more about them, you can find further details about these offerings at:</p>

</ul>
<p>OnMetal Cloud Servers with RackConnect are compatible with both our <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/" target="_blank">Managed Operations</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/" target="_blank">Managed Infrastructure</a> service level offerings, allowing you to get the level of support you need to properly manage your hybrid environment.</p>
<p>While in general, OnMetal servers and RackConnect work well together, there are some caveats to be aware of as you build out your hybrid infrastructure with these offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for OnMetal Cloud Servers is currently limited to the RackConnect v2.0 offering.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When using one of the portals to create RackConnected Cloud Servers, we normally recommend utilizing the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">MyRackspace Portal</a>, but in the case of OnMetal, support for creating OnMetal servers is currently limited to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a>. Additionally, you may also use the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-onmetal-cloud-servers-through-api" target="_blank">Cloud Servers API</a> to create your OnMetal servers. To summarize: when building OnMetal servers for use with RackConnect, please create them via the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> or <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-onmetal-cloud-servers-through-api" target="_blank">Cloud Servers API</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The complete set of OnMetal images may not be available for use with RackConnect. To view the current set of OnMetal images available, connect to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> using one of your cloud accounts associated with RackConnect, begin the process of creating a new Cloud Server, select the OnMetal™ Server tab, and then select the Image's drop-down selection field.<br /><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/OnMetal_Build_0.png" alt="" width="508" height="445" /><br />&nbsp; [Example of OnMetal Images available on a RackConnect associated cloud account.]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OnMetal servers may not be available in all regions. To view the regions where OnMetal is currently available, you can follow the same process listed above for viewing image availability, but instead of selecting the Image's drop-down selection field, you will select the Region's drop-down selection field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OnMetal servers are configured with 10 Gbps (gigabits per second) capable bonded NICs (network interface cards), but bandwidth availability via RackConnect will be limited to the capabilities of your RackConnect network device(s). As an extreme example, if you are using an ASA 5505 Sec+ as your RackConnect edge and connected network device, your OnMetal server's throughput via RackConnect will be limited to approximately 150 Mbps (megabits per second). For a detailed comparison of RackConnect network devices, please view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-network-device-comparison" target="_blank">RackConnect Network Device Comparison</a> article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One final caveat to note is that even though OnMetal servers require the use of SSH keys, the RackConnect automation systems will still create and utilize a 'rackconnect' user account for administering the OnMetal servers, so please do not disable, modify, or remove this user account. Additionally, the other <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-best-practices" target="_blank">RackConnect Best Practices</a> still apply to OnMetal servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that you have found this article helpful in getting your OnMetal Cloud Servers with RackConnect environment setup, but if you have any further questions, we are always here to help, so please reach out to us; contact information is available on the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/support" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
