<p>Although it is common to set up email clients such as Outlook after a migration, Rackspace mailboxes can be accessed at any time after they are created. &nbsp;Accessing the mailbox does not interrupt a migration in process.</p><p>Users who prefer webmail can log in via the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.rackspace.com">Rackspace Webmail URL</a>.</p><p>Users who prefer to use an email program such as Outlook will need to change their client settings in order to receive mail from the Rackspace servers. &nbsp;Depending on your migration strategy, changes to the email program settings may occur during or after the migration.</p><p>To help you and your end users have the best experience when switching over, Rackspace provides the following options for setting up user access before a migration is complete.</p><h3>Webmail Access<strong><br /></strong></h3><p><strong>Note</strong>: Webmail is immediately available to all users once the mailbox is created. It provides them with the ability to send and receive email even though their email clients have not yet been configured.</p><p>This option is primarily for users who access their email from a web-based interface.&nbsp; If you use this option, you can communicate with your users ahead of time and inform them that they must access their email from a new URL, <a href="https://apps.rackspace.com">https://apps.rackspace.com</a>, by your “go live” date.</p><p>End users requiring a desktop email client connection can get setup instructions after the migration is complete by going to the Rackspace Auto-Config Tool,&nbsp;<a href="https://emailhelp.rackspace.com">https://emailhelp.rackspace.com</a>.<a href="https://emailhelp.rackspace.com"><br /></a></p><h4>Benefits</h4><ul><li>Recommended and provides the least amount of downtime during transition</li><li>Fastest connection to the email server</li><li>Allows for immediate access to send and receive email</li><li>Ideal for remote users</li></ul><h3>Pre-Stage Email Client Setup</h3><p>This method is for users who are familiar with email client configurations and want to prepare for the migration ahead of time, specifically before your domain's MX record changes. &nbsp;This option lets users configure the new email account on their own and download data from the server while the migration is happening. &nbsp;The account remains dormant as the user continues to send and receive from their previous account. &nbsp;After the MX record changes, the new account downloads the differential mail data and that account becomes the primary account.</p><h4>Benefits</h4><ul><li>Allows end users to configure their local settings before going live</li><li>Allows end users with a large amount of data to begin downloading ahead of time</li><li>Allows administrators to take advantage of optimal download times such as evenings, nights, or weekends before going live</li><li>Allows administrators or end users to import local settings such as rules, signatures, and settings into the account before going live</li><li>Allows administrators to troubleshoot potential connectivity issues with the mail client before going live</li><li>Allows administrators to find internal DNS issues that might affect mail client configuration (for Internal DNS customers only)</li></ul><h4>Tips for Certain Versions of Outlook</h4><p><strong>Outlook 2007</strong>&nbsp;- Outlook 2007 does not support multiple Exchange accounts in the same profile.&nbsp; Therefore, a new profile must be created through the Windows Control Panel. &nbsp;IMAP and POP for Rackspace Email can simply be added into the same profile. For instructions on creating a new profile for Exchange, see the following article: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/manually-setting-up-outlook-2007-with-microsoft-exchange-2010">Manually Setting up a new profile with Outlook</a>.</p><p><strong>Outlook 2010+</strong>&nbsp;- Both Exchange and Rackspace Email accounts can be added to the same profile. &nbsp;Creating a new profile is not necessary with newer versions of Outlook.</p><p>To add an account in Outlook 2010+ click the <strong>File</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Add Account</strong> in the Account Information section.</p><h3><a name="ConfigurationResources"></a>Configuration Resources</h3><p><a href="https://apps.rackspace.com">Webmail link for Rackspace Email and Exchange</a></p><p><a href="https://emailhelp.rackspace.com">Auto-Config Tool </a>(recommended for new client setups)</p><p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-microsoft-exchange-email-clients-mobile-devices">Setup Exchange Email Clients and Mobile Devices</a></p><p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-rackspace-email-clients-mobile-devices">Setup Rackspace Email Clients and Mobile Devices&nbsp;</a></p>
