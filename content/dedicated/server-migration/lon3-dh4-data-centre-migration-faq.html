<p>Rackspace is opening a new data centre, LON5, in Q2 2015. The new data centre will support our customersâ€™ growth with newer technologies and enable us to offer customers our current hosting product portfolio. To this end, we will be closing all colocation data centre facilities in the UK. All customers' solutions currently hosted in the colocation facilities will be migrated to the new data centre, LON5.</p>

<p>Rackspace has had widespread success in data centre migrations over the past 12 years. During this time our dedicated migration teams have performed the following migrations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2009, migrated 15,000 devices from our LON2 Data Centre into our LON3 Data Centre</li>
	<li>In 2011, migrated 3,828 devices from our SAT1 and SAT2 Data Centres to our DFW1 Data Centre</li>
	<li>In 2012, migrated 8,200 devices from our IAD1 Data Centre to our DFW1 and IAD3 Data Centres</li>
</ul>

<p>During these migrations, the teams returned 100 percent of solutions online within the advertised move window and experienced a component failure rate of less than 1 percent.</p>

<p>We realise that you have chosen Rackspace as your hosting provider because you trust our expertise and commitment to support you. You can rest assured that we have invested significant planning and resources in thorough migration planning. This article answers many of the questions you might have about this planned migration. If you have further questions, see the contact information at the end of this article.</p>

<h3><a id="why" name="why"></a>Why is Rackspace closing DH4?</h3>

<p>DH4 was brought online in March 2013 to ease capacity issues in our LON3 Data Centre caused by extensive growth. At that stage LON5 was still in the initial design phase. It is a colocation facility in very close proximity to LON3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="stages" name="stages"></a>What are the high level stages of the migration?</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Your migration date will be determined by the location of your hosted devices. In order to minimise the impact to customers we will be moving servers in small contiguous blocks.</li>
	<li>Leading up to your migration date, Rackspace will work with you and your account team to establish any specific requirements for the move.</li>
	<li>On the date of your migration, all affected devices will be powered down.</li>
	<li>The affected devices will be securely transported to the new Data Centre facility.</li>
	<li>All devices will be reconnected and powered back up.</li>
	<li>Your configuration will be tested and verified at an infrastructure level. Further testing can be agreed with your account team.</li>
	<li>The geographical relocation will not be apparent to the outside world.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><a id="interruption" name="interruption"></a>Will there be any interruption to service?</h3>

<p>Yes. The total scheduled migration window will be eight hours but our goal is to return to service as quickly as possible. Rackspace has designed the migration plan to occur in small contiguous blocks in order to minimize the amount of downtime for customers. Our project plan also seeks to reduce the amount of unplanned downtime by including additional resources and multiple contingency plans.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="ipchanges" name="ipchanges"></a>Will there be any IP or DNS changes I need to worry about?</h3>

<p>No, the primary and secondary IP addresses of your devices will move with the devices to the new location. You will not need to make any changes to your DNS.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="when" name="when"></a>When are my servers scheduled to be migrated?</h3>

<p>The migration period will start in August and run through to October. You will receive a notification via a ticket on the Rackspace customer portal around 3 months in advance of your migration date which will include the specific date and time that your solution will be moved.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><a id="prepare" name="prepare"></a>How will I need to prepare for the migration?</h3>

<p>Rackspace will use all of our experience of Data Centre migration projects to help support you during the migration to LON5. We have put together a dedicated Migration Team made up of existing Rackers from across the business; this team will be working alongside you and your Account Team to determine and agree any special requirements you might have for pre and post migration instructions as we shut down and turn your solution back on. The Migration Team will then be focused on successfully executing on all the specifications set out on the night of the migration.</p>

<p>We would also encourage customers to make their own offsite backups as well as utilising the Managed Backup solution Rackspace offers. If your solution is not currently being backed up then we would strongly recommend that you talk to your Rackspace Account Team to get these in place before the migration date.</p>

<p>We will be issuing regular notification tickets at 90, 60, 30, 14 and 7 days prior to your migration date, as well as tickets on the night to keep you informed of progress.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="date" name="date"></a>Is the move date flexible, can I choose the date of the migration?</h3>

<p>The migration project has been split into phases based on the physical data centre configuration. To avoid having to change IP addresses on your solution we have to move customers in a set time frame during each phase. Rackspace will give you advance notice of this date and time so that you can plan accordingly with your customers and end users but&nbsp; we cannot change the date of your move without further impacting your solution.</p>

<p>If your scheduled migration date is so impractical for you that a rescheduled date becomes absolutely necessary then an IP address change might be required on your solution. This change will include DNS changes and potential configuration work on your side to accommodate the new IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<h3><a id="multiple" name="multiple"></a>I have more than one solution with Rackspace, will they all be migrated at the same time?</h3>

<p>This will depend on where those solutions are physically located within the Data Centre. The move has been split up into phases; if the solutions fall into the same phase then they will be moved in the same time frame. We aim to move all devices within the same account at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="services" name="services"></a>Will any of the services that Rackspace currently offer me change?</h3>

<p>There will be no change to any of the services that you currently consume. The only change to your solution will be the physical location.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="transport" name="transport"></a>How will my solution be transported?</h3>

<p>We will be using a third party specialist transport company. To ensure the safe transportation of your solution Rackspace has carefully and extensively planned this migration and selected appropriate partners to mitigate any risks arising from the move. Vendor analysis and risk evaluation and mitigation documents are available upon request from the migration team if you want to review them.</p>

<p>The vehicles will be loaded within our data centres and so will be subject to our stringent physical security controls and will be unloaded within the same conditions in LON5.&nbsp; The tailgate of the truck will be locked with a special bolt by Rackspace personnel. The trucks will have GPS tracking, they will not carry the Rackspace logo and will be followed by Rackspace personnel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="guarantees" name="guarantees"></a>Are there any guarantees that my server will not have to be migrated again afterwards?</h3>

<p>Rackspace has invested heavily in the design and construction of the LON5 Data Centre and in our partnership with Digital Realty Trust, a company dedicated to data centre design and construction.</p>

<p>The lease associated with the LON5 Data Centre is in excess of 20 years. We hope that this provides you some reassurance that we are making every effort not to migrate you again in the future.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="compensation" name="compensation"></a>Am I entitled to any compensation resulting from this move?</h3>

<p>In order to carry out the migration, we are scheduling a eight hour migration window as a scheduled maintenance. You may be entitled to a service credit under your contractual arrangements with Rackspace for downtime which is not associated with a permitted scheduled maintenance. You will be entitled to claim any service credit due to you in the normal manner.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="location" name="location"></a>Where is LON5 located?</h3>

<p>This facility is located near Crawley, Sussex. For security reasons, we have not published the address in this FAQ. You can obtain the address from your account team on a confidential basis and with valid justification, such as the need to coordinate the installation of private circuits.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="redundancy" name="redundancy"></a>Does the LON5 Data Centre have the same level of redundancy and security as DH4?</h3>

<p>Yes, the LON5 Data Centre provides the same or improved levels of redundancy and more resilience in its electrical and mechanical infrastructure than DH4. Security protocols and operations for LON5 are in line with all Data Centres in the Rackspace global portfolio.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="security" name="security"></a>What assurance can Rackspace provide customers regarding security controls in the new LON5 Data Centre?</h3>

<p>All Rackspace entities implement uniform global data centre security and environmental controls in their data centres.</p>

<p>The new LON5 Data Centre will implement the same standard security controls that have been implemented in our other data centres and that have been assessed in those other data centre as meeting the requirements of our ISO27001, PCI-DSS SP L1 and ISAE / SSAE standards.</p>

<p>LON5 will undergo external assessment against ISO27001 before opening to our customers, with the other compliance standards being audited externally in line with our set annual compliance schedule.</p>

<p>Customers will be able to request a copy of our ISO27001 certificate, as well as an attestation from our Compliance Director that states that the appropriate security and environmental controls have been implemented to meet the PCI DSS SP L1 and ISAE/ SSAE standards to which we adhere.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="report" name="report"></a>Has an SSAE16 / ISAE 3402 SOC report been completed for the LON5 Data Centre?</h3>

<p>The LON5 Data Centre will come online in the middle of the Rackspace ISAE / SSAE annual audit cycle and will therefore not be assessed upon opening.</p>

<p>The reporting period for the Rackspace Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3 reports is from 1 October to 31 September. The assessment will be conducted by our auditors between September and November 2015, with the final report being made available in early December 2015.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="compliance" name="compliance"></a>Will the LON5 Data Centre be PCI-DSS compliant?</h3>

<p>The LON5 Data Centre will come online before the Rackspace Annual PCI-DSS Service Provider audit.</p>

<p>The PCI-DSS SP L1 external audit will occur between May and July 2015. The Attestation of Compliance will then be available for customers by early August 2015.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&lt;return to top&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="green" name="green"></a>What are the green credentials of the new LON5 Data Centre?</h3>

<p>In support of our commitment to our customers, our employees and the environment, our LON3 Data Centre and our UK head office (LON4) are certified to the international environmental management standard, ISO14001, which provides a framework for managing our environmental responsibilities, including energy and waste management. We will extend the scope of this to LON5 in the next audit cycle. In the meantime following are some of the initiatives we have implemented in LON5 to reduce our carbon footprint:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The data centre construction will have a BREEAM rating of Very Good. BREEAM for new construction covers items such as environmentally sourced paint, LED lighting, minimising land fill and impact on environment during construction</li>
	<li>LON5 will have an annualised Power Usage Effectiveness (PuE) of 1.15 (versus 1.58 in LON3)</li>
	<li>Removal of the mechanical cooling systems in the data halls means we can maintain a more stable PuE rating for the facility</li>
	<li>The indirect cooling solution uses much less water than other systems in its class and significantly less water than a cooling tower.</li>
	<li>Rain harvesting will be leveraged and used in back-of-house amenities and for the adiabatic spray in the indirect cooling solution.</li>
	<li>Sun pipes in some areas will bring in natural light to reduce the need for artificial lighting.</li>
	<li>Power will be pulled into the site from higher up the grid to attain a more efficient delivery of power to the site.</li>
</ul>
