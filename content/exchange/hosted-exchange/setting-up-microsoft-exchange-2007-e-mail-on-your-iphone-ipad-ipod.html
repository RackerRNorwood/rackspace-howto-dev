<p>The following article below will get your Microsoft Exchange email account setup on your iPhone using the Activesync technology. Let's take a look at the&nbsp;steps below to get you going:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Your&nbsp;device must be a <strong>3G</strong>, <strong>3Gs</strong>,&nbsp;and with a <strong>4.0</strong>+ <strong>iOS</strong>.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. After your administrator has purchased an <strong>Activesync</strong> license and assigned it to your email address, you'll want to log into your <strong>User Control Panel</strong> at the following URL:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp" target="_blank">https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp</a></strong></p>

<p>2. Once you're logged in, scroll down to the <strong>Client Setup</strong> section and click on the <strong>ActiveSync</strong> link. This will open the <strong>Setting Up ActiveSync</strong> window which will contain the information needed to set up your device.</p>

<p>3. Once you have your&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync </strong>window open, tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon on the iPhone.</p>

<p>5. The Exchange setup screen will open; you'll then enter the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Email - Enter your entire email address (e.g., myname@mydomain.com), using all lowercase letters.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Domain - Enter the <strong>Domain address</strong>&nbsp;exactly as it is from the <strong>Setting Up ActiveSync </strong>window.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Username - Enter the <strong>User name</strong> exactly as it is from the <strong>Setting Up ActiveSync </strong>window. The <strong>User name</strong> is different from the email address.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Password - Enter in the password for your email account.</li>

<p>6. Tap the <strong>Next</strong> button and the device will attempt to verify the account. You may receive an "Unable to Verify Certificate message," go ahead and Tap the <strong>Accept</strong> button.</p>

<p>7. The device will than continue verifying the account. Once complete, tap the <strong>Server</strong> field, and enter the <strong>Server address</strong>&nbsp;exactly as it is from the <strong>Setting Up ActiveSync </strong>window.</p>

<p>8. Tap the <strong>Next</strong> button and the device will then try to create a secure (SSL) connection to your Exchange server. If it cannot do this, it will try a non-SSL connection. If it asks for a confirmation, go ahead and tap <strong>Yes</strong> to continue.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Your iPhone may take a moment to sync all your information depending on how much you have on the Exchange server. To learn more about the mail settings on your device tap&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;from the home screen, than&nbsp;Mail, Contacts, &amp; Calendars&nbsp;and than select your account. You'll be able to customize how much data you would like to sync from the server.</em></p>
