**APPLIES TO:** RackConnect v3.0

RackConnect v3.0 is a hybrid offering that provides network connectivity
between your dedicated and cloud environments. By default, you can
manage your dedicated environment from within the
[MyRackspace](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list) portal
but it does not allow you to manage any of your cloud environments. In
order to perform some cloud account administration tasks from the
[MyRackspace](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list) portal,
you must ***link*** your cloud accounts with your dedicated account. The
linking of your dedicated account with your cloud accounts is how you
inform us that your dedicated and cloud accounts belong to the same
organization, and this then allows you to perform some cloud account
administration functions from within the
[MyRackspace](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list) portal
itself.

A RackConnect v3.0 ***configuration*** represents a single deployment of
a RackConnect solution.  A configuration is comprised of dedicated
network devices that function in the RackConnect edge and connected
network device roles, along with the stored settings needed to make
these devices function with RackConnect. You may have multiple
RackConnect configurations. A configuration is normally associated with
one or more cloud accounts. Please view the [RackConnect Key
Terms](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-key-terms)
article for further details.

Once you have linked your cloud accounts with your dedicated account,
you will then be able to ***associate*** your cloud accounts with your
RackConnect v3.0 configurations from within the
[MyRackspace](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list) portal.
Associating a cloud account with RackConnect v3.0 is how you inform us
which of your linked cloud accounts should be associated with a
particular RackConnect v3.0 configuration. Once you have associated a
cloud account with one of your RackConnect v3.0 configurations, a ticket
will automatically be generated for us, where we will work with you to
fully configure the cloud account for use with RackConnect v3.0. Please
view the [RackConnect v3.0
Requirements](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-v30-requirements)
article for further details.

Details on linking and associating a cloud account are listed below.

Details on Associating a Cloud Account with your RackConnect v3.0 Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Ensure that you have already linked a cloud account to your
    dedicated account.  You can verify this from the
    [MyRackspace](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list) portal
    by navigating to **Products** \> **Rackspace Cloud**. Your linked
    cloud account's details will be displayed on the right-pane of the
    screen.

2.  After you have linked a cloud account, you can click the plus sign
    (+) under the RackConnect column to associate a cloud account with
    one of your RackConnect configurations. In most cases, you have only
    one RackConnect configuration:<br>
