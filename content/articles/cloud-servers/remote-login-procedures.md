To work with your cloud server you must establish a connection to it
from your local computer. How you make the connection depends on your
server operating system and desktop operating system.

Linux server
------------

Use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to your Linux server. For connection
instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop operating
system:

-   [Connecting to Linux from Mac OS X by using
    Terminal](/knowledge_center/node/1225)
-   [Connecting to Linux from Windows by using
    PuTTY](/knowledge_center/node/68)

If you can't use SSH to access a Linux server remotely, you can
access its command line by using the [console in the Cloud Control
Panel](/knowledge_center/node/1356).

Windows server
--------------

Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log in to your Windows server. For
connection instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop
operating system:

-   [Logging in to Your Server via RDP
    (Windows)](/knowledge_center/node/368)
-   [Log in to your server with RDP (Mac)](/knowledge_center/node/371)
