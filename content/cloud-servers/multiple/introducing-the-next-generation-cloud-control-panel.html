<p>The<a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com"> Cloud Control Panel</a> lets you manage your Rackspace Cloud infrastructure through a simple and intuitive interface. This article introduces you to some of the features of the control panel that will make your daily administration tasks seem effortless.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>

<p>Product area headings (Servers, Networking, Storage, Databases, Orchestration, and Backups) run across the top of the screen.

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>Several features help you organize, find, and efficiently manage your resources no matter the size or shape of your cloud inventory.</p>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>Tags let you add customized labels to any of the resources that make up your cloud infrastructure. You are in charge of your tags--create as many as you'd like and assign them as needed. For example, you could distinguish your servers by their functional role, a certain website association, a specific technology, or even by geographical location.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="162" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/NewCPTagging_1.png" width="494" /></p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>Filters help you find all resources that share the following common properties: Tag, Status, Image, RAM, Region, or Type. The list of your filters is located at the left side of the control panel. When you create and tag resources, the list is automatically populated. When you select a check box next to a filter, the list of resources shows only the matching ones.</p>

<p>An example of what the filters might look like for Cloud Servers:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="534" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1355.1.png" width="178" /></p>

<p>Tags are included in the list of filters, which gives you a powerful yet simple way to find only the specific resources that you want to work with. For example, you could filter your list of servers to show all 2 GB servers that you've tagged as <strong>Production</strong>. Using the Status filter, you can drill down even further and find the servers that are currently running, offline, or have a different status.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>A convenient and fast search field in the upper-right corner of each asset listing gives you another method for locating any asset. Simply enter part of the asset name, tag, or IP address in the search field.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" height="149" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1355.2.png" width="281" /></p>

<p>When you use tags, filters, and search, your cloud inventory can grow to any size and you'll still be able to promptly locate and manage any asset.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Administrative actions</h2>

<p>The control panel provides a variety of ways to perform administrative tasks. Whether you're looking at a list of assets or a detailed view of a single asset, you don't need to leave your current location to perform a task--every&nbsp;task you might want to perform is accessible right where you are.</p>

<h3>Actions gear</h3>

<p>When viewing resources in a list, click the gear icon to the left of the resource name to access a drop-down menu with all available actions for that resource.&nbsp;The actions gear is always part of every list, whether it's a list of servers, files, or load balancers. The following image shows the actions gear drop-down menu for a cloud server named 1TestVyatta:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="411" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1355.3.png" width="227" /></p>

<h3>Actions menu</h3>

<p>If you're looking at the details of a specific resource, you'll find the <strong>Actions&nbsp;</strong>drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" height="366" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1355.4.png" width="157" /></p>

<h3>Edit pencils and options</h3>

<p>You can also edit an existing setting for a resource by clicking the edit pencil or option that appears next to the resource description. For example, you could rebuild the image or add a record by clicking the option that appears after the description for each setting.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="414" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1355.5.png" width="603" /></p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Popup boxes</h3>

<p>When you perform an administrative action on a resource, a popup dialog box lets you modify the settings or perform an action without taking you to another page. You can modify a resource much faster because you don't have to wait for the page to reload.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Accessing the Cloud Sites Control Panel</h2>

<p>You can reach the Cloud Sites Control Panel by selecting the option from the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> drop-down menu at the top left of the Cloud Control Panel.</p>
