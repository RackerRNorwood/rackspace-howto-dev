<p>Paravirtualization and hardware virtualization are modes of virtualization used by the hypervisor to run the virtual machine. This article compares paravirtualization (PV) with&nbsp;a mode that combines aspects of paravirtualization with full hardware virtualization (PVHVM).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, PVHVM offers better performance than PV, especially for disk and network IO, but is not well supported in Linux operating systems with a kernel version earlier than 2.6.36. The availability of PV and PVHVM images in the Rackspace Cloud is determined by the effectiveness of each virtualization mode for that particular operating system. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If both PV and PVHVM options are available for the OS that you choose to use, consider the following factors when choosing between them.</p>

<p><strong>Performance: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Network and disk IO are faster with PVHVM images because QEMU emulation is bypassed.</span></li>
	<li><span>PVHVM requires a bit more memory overhead than PV. If your application is memory intensive, or if it is optimized for PV Memory Management Units, PV might be a better choice.</span></li>
	<li><span>If you are striving for performance optimization, test both options to determine which one performs better for your application. </span></li>
	<li>Work-optimized servers (Compute, I/O, and Memory) require PVHVM images. If you try to create a work-optimized server by using a non-PVHVM image, the following error message is displayed: <code>"Image cannot be built with provided flavor."</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>File system: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Ext3 is used for all Linux PV Linux images.</span></li>
	<li><span>Ext4 is used for all Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and Ubuntu PVHVM images.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Boot loader:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>PV images boot via pygrub.</span></li>
	<li><span>PVHVM images boot via the boot loader in the master boot record of the operating system.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disk configuration: </strong></p>

<p><span>Automatic disk configuration can be used with PV images but fails with PVHVM images. The error message looks as follows:</span><br />
<code>ERROR: Requested image $UUID has automatic disk resize disabled. (HTTP 400)</code></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
