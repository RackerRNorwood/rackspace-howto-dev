<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking your username in the upper-right corner of the control panel and selecting Cloud Sites Control Panel.<em><br /></em></p>
<p>If you want to purchase a domain but are not ready to use it for a website, you can "park" the domain. A parked domain is a domain that is registered but doesn't point to a website -- although you always have the option to point the domain to a website at a later date.</p>
<p>To register a parked domain with Cloud Sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your Cloud Sites Control Panel at <a class="external free" title="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com" href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com" rel="nofollow">http://manage.rackspacecloud.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the control panel, click the "Hosting" link in the left navigation bar. Then select "Cloud Sites". Then select "Add a New Website".</li>
<li>Under "Add a New Website," select the Site Owner from the pull-down menu and enter the Domain Name in the next box.</li>
<li>Select the term length for the purchase of the domain.</li>
<li>Under "Other Options" select the "Domain Registration Only (park domain)" option and click "Next."</li>
</ol>
<p>You should then receive confirmation that Cloud Sites has added your website to your account.</p>
