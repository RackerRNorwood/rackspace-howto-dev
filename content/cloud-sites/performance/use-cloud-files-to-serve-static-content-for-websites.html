<p>Use the following steps to set up a website from a basic HTML page stored in Cloud Files.</p>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>To complete this process, you need the following items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A file transfer application such as <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-rackspace-cloud-files-with-cyberduck">Cyberduck</a>.</li>
	<li>A text editor</li>
	<li>Images to display on the website</li>
	<li>A Cloud Files account</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upload and connect to your content</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Cloud Control Panel.</li>
	<li>In the Cloud Files section, create a new container and select <strong>Public (Enabled CDN) </strong>for the type.<br />
	<strong>Tip</strong>: Creating separate containers for your image and HTML files can be helpful.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Upload Files</strong> and select any images or additional content that you will be using in your site.</li>
	<li>Click the action gear next to each of the uploaded items, select <strong>View All Links</strong> and record &nbsp;the URLs for each item.</li>
	<li>In a text editor, create a sample HTML page that lays out the basic form of your website. Following is an example:<br />
	<img alt="" height="159" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/sitelayoutpage_0.png" width="673" /></li>
	<li value="5">Incorporate the public URLs of your images and additional content into your site layout document where those are referenced. For example, <strong>"http://c0344252.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/phpsite2.img"</strong> in the preceding example is an incorporated reference for an image file uploaded to Cloud Files.</li>
	<li value="6">In the container in Cloud Files, click <strong>Upload Files</strong> and select the site layout file that you just created.</li>
	<li value="7">Click the action gear next to the HTML file, select <strong>View All Links</strong> and record the <strong>HTTP </strong>path. This is your siteâ€™s public URL.</li>
	<li value="8">
	<p>Point the browser to the URL of the site layout page that you just created (for example, <code><strong>http://www.example.com.websitetestlink.com/index.html</strong>)</code>&nbsp; and verify that the image is served.<br />
	The image is being served from Cloud Files through the Akamai CDN.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
