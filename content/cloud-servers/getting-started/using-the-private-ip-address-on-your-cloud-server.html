<p>Each Cloud Server comes with two addresses that are available for your use. One address is an external ”real-world” IP address that is accessible from the Internet and the other is an internal or "private" IP address. &nbsp;This internal IP address is on a network commonly called ServiceNet and is used within the Cloud.</p>

<div>
<h4>Why do Cloud Servers have an Internal IP Address?</h4>
</div>

<p>This IP address is an internal address that is only accessible by the Cloud Server platforms because it allows you to transfer data between Cloud Servers with no bandwidth charges.</p>

<div>
<h4>Is ServiceNet Free?</h4>
</div>

<p>Yes! This is a standard service that is offered with each Cloud Server at no additional cost. Your Cloud Server is pre-configured with your private IP address as soon as it is built.</p>

<div>
<h4>How Do I Find My Private IP Address?</h4>

<p>If you log into your Cloud Server, via SSH or the Console, you can type the command ip addr show eth1on most distributions to find your private IP address. Then look for the inet addrline. A sample output is posted here:</p>
</div>

<div>
<pre>
    # ip addr show eth1</pre>

<pre>
    eth1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Link encap:Ethernet&nbsp; HWaddr 00:18:78:56:34:12&nbsp;
    ; inet addr:10.1.98.200&nbsp; Bcast:10.1.98.255&nbsp; Mask:255.255.255.0</pre>

<p>**** You will need the address on the second line next to 'inet addr:'.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>What can I use the private address for?</h4>

<p>The private IP address&nbsp;has many uses:</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>High-availability Heartbeat</li>
	<li>Load balancing</li>
	<li>Remote database connections</li>
	<li>NFS/rsync</li>
	<li>Remote backup</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the possibilities are endless!</p>
