<p><strong>Note</strong>: This article is written for our <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_self">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can get to it from the Cloud Control Panel by clicking your name in the upper-right corner and selecting <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_self">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p><span>Now that you are familiar with how to manage all of your account details under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/node/2005">Your Account</a>&nbsp;tab, the next section in the left navigation menu will show you how to get Fanatical Support through our many support channels.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>When you click on the Support drop-down menu, you will see the following items:</span>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="#devresources"><span>Developer Resources</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="#cloudstatus"><span>Cloud Status</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="#kc"><span>Knowledge Base</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="#forums"><span>Forums</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="#tickets"><span>Tickets</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="#livechat"><span>Live Chat</span></a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>You will also notice that the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Cloud Status</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Knowledge Base</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Forums</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Tickets</span></strong><span>, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Live Chat</span></strong><span>&nbsp;links are available across the top menu of all pages, as well as the Support phone numbers for the United States and United Kingdom. &nbsp;If you are ever experiencing a critical problem and need immediate support, please call as at one of these numbers:</span>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><span>United States 24-hour Support: &nbsp;800-961-4454</span></strong></li>
		<li><strong><span>United Kingdom 24-hour Support: &nbsp;0800-083-3012</span></strong></li>
		<li><strong><span>International: 1-210-312-4000</span></strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span>If you are not experiencing a critical problem, you may be able to find the answer you are looking for through one of our other Support channels. &nbsp;Below is a detailed description of the resources available through these channels, and suggestions for the best way to use them.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a name="devresources"></a>Developer Resources</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- Here you will find links to the github repositories for the .NET, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby language bindings for our products. &nbsp;You can also find links to HTML and downloadable .PDF guides for the API documentation. &nbsp;You can always access these Developer Guides directly by going to:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/api/"><span>http://docs.rackspace.com/api/</span></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a id="CS" name="cloudstatus"></a>Cloud Status</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- Having a problem getting to the Control Panel, or any other Rackspace Cloud services? &nbsp;The first place you should check is the Cloud Status page. &nbsp;This is where we list all maintenances and service impacting events. &nbsp;There is a different Status page for&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Cloud Sites</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Cloud Servers</span></strong><span>, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Cloud Files</span></strong><span>. &nbsp;This is because a maintenance or outage may only be impacting one product, while others remain unaffected. &nbsp;Make sure to note the Event Date (green box) and differentiate from the Posted Date (red box). &nbsp;Since the events will appear in the order that they were posted, you may need to scroll down through the list to find scheduled maintenances that were posted earlier.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/3Status.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a id="KBKC" name="kc"></a>Knowledge Base / Knowledge Center</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- This valuable resource contains numerous articles, tutorials, videos, white papers, and webinars to help you find all available information on using the Rackspace Cloud. &nbsp;How do we know it's valuable? &nbsp;Because&nbsp;<em><strong>you are using it right now!</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get to the Knowledge Center directly by going to: &nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center"><span>http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center</span></a></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/3kc.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>If you already know what you are looking for, the easiest way to find it is to enter keywords in the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Search</span></strong><span>&nbsp;bar at the top. &nbsp;Selecting the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Advanced Search</span></strong><span>&nbsp;option will allow you the option to filter your search returns by&nbsp;</span><strong><span>article type</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>product category</span></strong><span>, or by specific&nbsp;</span><strong><span>article ID&nbsp;</span></strong><span>after checking the box in the lower-right corner. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/4KC.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>You can obtain the article ID from the address bar of each article. &nbsp;For example, the article ID for this article that you are reading is:&nbsp;</span><strong><span>2033</span></strong><span>. &nbsp;If you wanted to access this article directly, you could use the Advanced Search - Search by Article ID, and enter the number&nbsp;</span><strong><span>2033</span></strong><span>&nbsp;to pull up this article. &nbsp;Go ahead and try it now!</span></li>

<ul>
	<li><span>If you don't know exactly what you are looking for, you can browse the Support Categories under the&nbsp;<strong>I Need Help With:</strong>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/5KC.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Clicking the arrows next to a selection will expand the sub-categories for that topic. &nbsp;You can also click the&nbsp;<strong>VIEW ALL</strong>&nbsp;link at the bottom of each topic to see the full list of categories.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a id="F" name="forums"></a>Forums&nbsp;</span></strong><span>- this is the section for our customers to interact and discuss topics related to their Rackspace Cloud services. &nbsp;The first time that you click on this link, you will notice that you are prompted to log in.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/6Forums.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Your Forums credentials are separate from your Control Panel login. &nbsp;In order to be activated on the Forums, you will need to click the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Register</span></strong><span>&nbsp;link, create a username/password combination specifically for the Forums, and then contact Support to have the account activated.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/registerforums.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a id="T" name="tickets"></a>Tickets</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- the best way to communicate with our Support Technicians and provide specific details about a problem that you are experiencing is by opening a ticket. &nbsp;The advantage of using a ticket is that it allows you to copy &amp; paste or attach (20 MB limit) cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log entries directly into the ticket. &nbsp;As you can imagine, trying to communicate this information over the phone is problematic at best. &nbsp;All of our tickets carry a 24 hour response time SLA.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="http://c739518.r18.cf2.rackcdn.com/7tickets.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><a id="LC" name="livechat"></a>Live Chat&nbsp;</span></strong><span>- We have Support Technicians standing by 24 hours a day to answer any questions you have. &nbsp;Under the Live Chat link, you will be directed into a Live Chat session with specialists trained to support our various products. &nbsp;Choose the appropriate Live Chat link for the product you need assistance with.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>With all the support resources and support staff made available to you, it's no wonder why Rackspace is known as the home of Fanatical Support! &nbsp;This&nbsp;completes our tour of the Control Panel.</p>
