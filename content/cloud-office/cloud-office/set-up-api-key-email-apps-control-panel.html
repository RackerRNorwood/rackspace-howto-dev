<p>The Rackspace Email API provides most of the functions of the control panel through a REST-based web API. Whether you are adding a new customer account (for resellers), adding mailboxes, or using any of the other supported features, the API allows your application to administer the changes. These changes can be applied independent of your application's language or nature. Documentation for the API is located at: <a href="http://api-wiki.apps.rackspace.com/api-wiki/index.php/RestAPI" target="_blank">http://api-wiki.apps.rackspace.com/api-wiki/index.php/RestAPI.</a></p>

<p>To implement the API into your application, you must first generate an API key.&nbsp; API keys are unique to each administrator. To differentiate human actions and application actions, consider creating a separate administrator login for your API. Only super administrators will have access to the API.</p>

<p>To generate an API key, <a href="https://apps.rackspace.com/?cp" target="_blank">log in to the control panel</a>, and perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>At the top of the page, clickÂ <strong>My Account</strong.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Administrators</strong> section, click <strong>API Keys</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Generate New Keys</strong> to create new API keys.<br />
	<strong>Warning: </strong>Existing keys previously being used, generating new keys will break applications that are using the existing keys.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Avoid recording the API key information outside of the control panel.<strong>This information allows unrestricted access to make changes to your account. Use extreme discretion when using these keys.</strong></p>

<p>No further action is needed in the control panel. You can now develop applications for your account!</p>
