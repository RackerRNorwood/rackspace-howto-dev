*Note:* *The amber dot may take a minute or two to change from amber to
green; If it doesn't, check the accounts settings and password and make
sure you're using the correct EWS server address.* *Note: **If you
already have email on the server, your email will slowly begin to
populate your inbox. This can take some time dependning on how much data
you have.*
