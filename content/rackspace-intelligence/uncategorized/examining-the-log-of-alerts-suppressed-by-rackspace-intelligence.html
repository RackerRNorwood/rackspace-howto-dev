<p>You can use the <strong>Suppressed Alerts</strong> log to review alerts that were muted but ordinarily would have prompted notifications.</p>

<p>It is good practice to check the list of suppressed alerts after a suppression period ends to confirm that everything that was supressed relates to the purpose of the suppression. For example, if all alerts were suppressed during a scheduled maintenance period, alerts related to servers that were not expected to be disrupted should be investigated.</p>

<p>To learn more about an entity, notification plan, or suppression in the log, click its name. If it has not been deleted, you can then see its detailed description.</p>
