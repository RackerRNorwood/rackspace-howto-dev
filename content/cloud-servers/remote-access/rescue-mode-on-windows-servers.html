<h4>When should I use Rescue Mode?</h4>

<p>If your Windows system has become non-bootable or is suffering from critical system errors, you can use&nbsp;<strong>Rescue Mode</strong> to recover your system data. These problems may be caused by file system corruption, boot file corruption, or other configuration errors. Normally, if your system encounters any problem during the boot process, you would boot in to a maintenance mode environment known as Safe Mode that would allow you to login with your root password and check for any errors. Unfortunately, using Safe User Mode has its share of problems:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most services such as networking are disabled. This would prevent you from copying your data to another server.</li>
	<li>You would have to access your server using the Console, which is slower than using a traditional RDP login.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid having to use Safe Mode, you can bring your server up in <strong>Rescue Mode</strong> through the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<h4><a id="What_is_Rescue_mode" name="What_is_Rescue_mode"></a><strong>What is Rescue mode?</strong></h4>

<p>Rescue mode grants the Administrator user full access to your non-bootable serverâ€™s filesystem. You can use it to modify problems in configuration files or to copy data from your Cloud Server to a remote location. Rescue Mode through the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel is similar to booting into safe mode with networking enabled.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <u>Cloud Control Panel</u>, and click <strong>Servers</strong>.</li>
	<li>From your list of servers, click the Actions cog next to the server that you want to bring up in Rescue Mode and select <strong>Enter Rescue Mode&nbsp;</strong>from the drop-down menu.<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="400" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Windowsenter.png" width="201" /></li>
	<li value="3">Read the text in the Rescue Mode pop-over and then click&nbsp;<strong>Enter Rescue Mode</strong>.<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="327" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/rescuepopup.png" width="600" /></li>
	<li value="4">The temporary password is displayed. Copy the password to a safe location since you won't be able to see it again after closing this message.</li>
	<li value="5">After copying the temporary password click <strong>Dismiss Password</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The server will start to enter Rescue Mode and the initial status should be <strong>Entering rescue mode</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="327" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/winrescue.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>When the Rescue Mode build is complete, the status will turn red and display <strong>Rescue</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="338" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/rescueactive.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>Notice that the rescue environment is limited to 24 hours. This means that you will have one day to correct the problems on your server before it automatically reverts to its original state.</p>

<h4><a id="Connecting_to_your_server_in_Rescue_Mode" name="Connecting_to_your_server_in_Rescue_Mode"></a>Connecting to your server in Rescue Mode</h4>

<p>You can now use a RDP client to connect to your server using the public IP address and the temporary Administrator password to login to Rescue Mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="450" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/rdpclient.png" width="387" /></p>

<h4><a id="Troubleshooting_your_server_in_Rescue_Mode" name="Troubleshooting_your_server_in_Rescue_Mode"></a>Troubleshooting your server in Rescue Mode</h4>

<p>Before you can access the files on your server you'll need to mount the server's file system. To do that you'll need to look at your partitions to determine your file system's device.&nbsp;<strong>NOTE: If you plan on using chkdsk on this filesystem, DO NOT MOUNT the filesystem.</strong></p>

<p>Once you've logged into your server in Rescue Mode, Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and&nbsp;enter the search box&nbsp;<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>. Click <strong>diskmgmt&nbsp;</strong>to start the program.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="400" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/diskmgmt.png" width="320" /></p>

<p>Once the program is running, the output should resemble this:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="373" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/diskmgmtoutput.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>This shows us the device and the size of the disk. Here is a description of the different disks in the screenshot:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Disk 0 is the rescue file system and is currently being used as C:\</li>
	<li>Disk 1 is your system disk and will need to be set to online in order to work with your data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Right click on the Disk 1 and select online.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="260" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/disk1.png" width="417" /></p>

<p>Your system disk will be set as drive D:\ and you will now be able to access your data.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" border="2" height="374" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/ddrive.png" width="600" /></p>

<h4><a id="Exiting_Rescue_Mode" name="Exiting_Rescue_Mode"></a><strong>Exiting Rescue Mode</strong></h4>

<p>Once you are done troubleshooting your system, you can exit Rescue Mode by clicking the button labeled <strong>Exit Rescue Mode</strong> in the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel on your Server Details page.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some versions of the Windows OS will modify the original disk signature when mounted a secondary drive. &nbsp;If you reboot, you'll probably get a winload.exe error or a 0xc000000e error. &nbsp;This occurs with the BCD boot loader and not with the NTLDR loader. &nbsp;If that happens, you can re-rescue the system, and fix up the bootloader so it has the proper signature. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-essentials-rescue-mode-on-windows-cloud-servers">click here for instructions</a></p>
