The connection details we look at during basic network daemon troubleshooting are the addresses the daemon is listening on (including the port number), the daemon's PID (process identifier), and the program name.</p><p class="p">Of course, you need to run netstat on the server running the service. Remember that netstat is not affected by your firewall configuration.</p></div></div><div id="task_dcl_2jv_ng" class="topic task nested0"><h3 class="title topictitle1">Checking ports</h3><div class="body taskbody"><div class="section steps-informal"><p class="p">To list tcp ports that are being listened on, along with the name of each listener's daemon and its PID, run:</p><pre class="pre codeblock">sudo netstat -plnt

Then enable the correct service when netstat shows the port is free, e.g. "<samp class="ph codeph">sudo service vsftpd start</samp>".</p><p class="p">If you make any changes because the incorrect service is listening or nothing is, run the netstat command again to see if it has made a difference. If netstat doesn't show the program listening on the correct port you need to address its configuration before you go any further.</p></div></div><div id="concept_s5f_njv_ng" class="topic concept nested0"><h3 class="title topictitle1">Outcome</h3><div class="body conbody"><p class="p">If you make changes at this point make sure to test your setup – you may have resolved your issue.</p><p class="p">If not, let's continue to test connections to the service by using <a class="xref" href="/knowledge_center/content/testing-network-services-netcat">the netcat command.</a></p></div></div>
