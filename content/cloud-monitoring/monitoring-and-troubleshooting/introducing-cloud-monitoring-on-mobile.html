<p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.538em;">The new Rackspace Cloud mobile application for iOS and Android devices enables you to instantly monitor the health of your cloud infrastructure.&nbsp; The Rackspace Cloud mobile app, when used with Cloud Monitoring, provides you with timely and accurate information about how your resources are performing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This article describes how to get started with the app and perform the following Cloud Monitoring actions on your mobile device:</p><ul><li>View the status of any current alarm</li><li>View historical data and graphs that show trends over time</li><li>View monitoring check and alarm details</li><li>Understand error conditions</li></ul><h2>Get Started</h2><p>First, you need to install Cloud Monitoring on your cloud resources, if it is not already installed.&nbsp; For information about using the Cloud Control Panel or the Cloud Monitoring API to set up monitoring, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/getting-started/cloud-monitoring" target="_blank">Getting Started With Cloud Monitoring</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Download the Application</h2><p>To download the Rackspace cloud app for mobile devices, click the following link for your device:</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rackspace-cloud-control/id672443103?mt=8" target="_blank"><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK.png" alt="" width="203" height="60" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rackspace.cloudmobile" target="_blank"><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/en_app_rgb_wo_60.png" alt="" width="172" height="60" /></a></p><p>For instructions on how to log in and add accounts to your device, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-the-rackspace-mobile-application-and-managing-accounts" target="_blank">Getting Started with the Rackspace Mobile Application and Managing Accounts</a>.</p><h2>Open the Monitoring Screen</h2><p>On the main menu of the app on your device, tap&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring</strong>.&nbsp; A number on the main menu, as shown in the following example, indicates that you have one or more resources with an alarm in a critical or warning state.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/newMonitoringScreen.png" alt="" width="468" height="337" /></p><p>On the Monitoring home screen, you can view a list of monitored resources and their current status.&nbsp; By tapping the different status icons, you can view resources with at least one alarm in Critical, Warning, or OK state.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Alarms in a Critical state are shown in red.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Alarms in a Warning state are shown in yellow.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Alarms in OK state are shown as green.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Alarms with an error or unknown state are shown in grey.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>In the following example, the account has one resource with an alarm in a critical state, which is shown, and 10 resources with alarms in an OK state.</p><p>In the following example, the account has one resource with an alarm in a critical state.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/newResourceWithCriticalState.png" alt="" width="452" height="213" /></p><p>If a resource has multiple alarms with different states (for example, one critical alarm and one warning alarm), the resource appears by default on the status tab of the <em>most critical state</em>.</p><h2>View Monitoring Details</h2><p>If you tap a resource, you can see the monitoring checks, the alarm status of each check, and a graph showing data over time.</p><p>In the following example, the Remote Ping check has a problem.&nbsp; Click on the check to expand the view and see a graph of data over time. You can swipe to view multiple graphs.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/newMonitoringDetails.png" alt="" width="498" height="678" /></p><h2>View Errors</h2><p>Monitored resources that are highlighted in grey might have an error. You can diagnose errors with checks by visiting the Cloud Control Panel (for Cloud Servers), or by using the Cloud Monitoring API (for all other resources).</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/newDetailsGray.png" alt="" width="524" height="389" /></p><h2>View Resources with No Status Available</h2><p>If your monitored resource is grey, it might have no status. &nbsp;A resource can have no status for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>You have disabled all alarms.</li><li>You have deleted all alarms.</li></ul><p>When there are no alarms configured, there are no thresholds to trigger a change in the state of the alarms and the app cannot deliver a status for that resource. &nbsp;You can configure alarms for Cloud Servers in&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">the Cloud Control Panel</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. To configure alarms for all other resources, use&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">the Monitoring API</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. &nbsp;F</span>or information about how to use the API, see the<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;</span><em><a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cm/api/v1.0/cm-devguide/content/overview.html" target="_blank">Cloud Monitoring Developer Guide</a></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">.</span></p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/newDetailsNoAlarm.png" alt="" width="555" height="226" /></p><h2>Monitor Cloud Databases</h2><p>Cloud Databases are provisioned with six default checks and one alarm.&nbsp; Cloud Database users can view metrics and graphs for all checks <em>except</em> the MySQL check.&nbsp;</p><p>The preconfigured alarm provides warning and critical thresholds for low disk space <em>only</em>.&nbsp; For this reason, the status bar on any MySQL instance shows a green status whenever the disk space is within threshold.&nbsp; There is no status change if other checks are high or low because no alarms or thresholds have been set.&nbsp; You can configure additional alarms and notification plans by using the Cloud Databases API.&nbsp; For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-devguide/content/Monitoring_Cloud_Databases-d1e4673.html" target="_blank">Monitoring Cloud Databases</a> section in the&nbsp;<em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Cloud Databases Developer Guide</span></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">.&nbsp; At this time, Cloud Database users cannot configure additional checks.</span></p>
