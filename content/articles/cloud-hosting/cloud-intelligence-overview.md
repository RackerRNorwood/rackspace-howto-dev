All your IT operations data at your fingertips
----------------------------------------------

Rackspace Intelligence provides a universal dashboard for your data
sources and processes by correlating monitoring and system events to
mapped services. This user-friendly dashboard delivers a real-time and
comprehensive overview of the health of your infrastructure at one
glance. You can use Rackspace Intelligence to analyze your overall
system performance and quickly optimize the performance and availability
of your IT services. By giving you seamless access to any service and
resource metrics, Rackspace Intelligence helps you make intelligent
decisions when planning your system capacity and capability.

Rackspace Intelligence utilizes and incorporates data from Cloud
Monitoring and Cloud Metrics and will soon be expanded to provide deeper
insights using data from other Rackspace Products, including Cloud
Feeds.

Rackspace Intelligence provides an easy-to-access, user-friendly
graphical UI that is reliable and consistent no matter how you grow your
IT infrastructure. You can access Rackspace Intelligence by going to
[https://intelligence.rackspace.com](http://intelligence.rackspace.com)
or by logging into your [Cloud Control Panel
account](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

The Rackspace Intelligence UI lets you perform the following tasks:

-   Configure monitoring on your entities by setting checks and alarms.
-   View your monitoring status.
-   Generate visualizations of your system data to understand how your
    system is performing by using default or custom graphs.
-   Temporarily suppress all alarms on an entity.
-   Create notification plans and notifications for your alarms.
-   Obtain additional insights into the various operations of your IT
    infrastructure.

The Rackspace Intelligence UI consists of multiple pages that walk you
through the different elements of monitoring your data and obtaining
performance information. For a detailed description of the Rackspace
Intelligence UI, see (link to Shane's blog post).

Rackspace Intelligence currently does not expose an API.
