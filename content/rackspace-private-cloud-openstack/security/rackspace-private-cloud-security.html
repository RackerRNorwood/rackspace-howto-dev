<h2>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack Security Configuration Options</h2>

<p>OpenStack offers a variety of options on how to secure a private cloud.</p>

<h3>Authentication/Identity Management</h3>

<p>Within our OpenStack private cloud, identities can be authenticated using either internal or external authentication protocols like: LDAP and Active Directory. This allows enterprises to reuse their existing identity management infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Authorization/Role Management</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack&nbsp;provides preconfigured roles and role assignment. Roles provide fine-grained authorization over specific actions and are assigned to identified users. Customers can define custom roles to meet specific compliance or operational needs, e.g. segregation of duties. These are defined within each of the cloud components.</p>

<p>For example, a 'Cloud Operator' role might be configured to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add a new nova compute guest VM</li>
	<li>Add additional storage to a zone</li>
	<li>View an availability zone but not create one</li>
</ul>

<h3>Host Operating Systems</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack recommends hardening the host Operating Systems. Many current Private Cloud customers currently do this and our Openstack private cloud&nbsp;team will collaborate with customers to recommend a strategy based upon current corporate standards.</p>

<h3>Guest/VM Operating Systems</h3>

<p>The OpenStack Image Service (based on the Glance project), as implemented in&nbsp;our OpenStack private cloud, can be integrated into an Enterprise's existing change management and image release process. This allows the use of an organizations existing, hardened images. Please consult with the OpenStack private cloud team for a list of the latest supported base Operating Systems.</p>

<h3>Multi-Tenancy</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack, is just that, a private cloud OpenStack platform in a dedicated physical&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;A core element of OpenStack is its support for multi-tenancy. Our OpenStack private cloud&nbsp;leverages multi-tenancy&nbsp;by initially installing a configuration that ensures isolation between tenants. Tenant isolation can be used to prevent unrestricted communication between business units or application domains. This best practice safeguards against cross-VLAN communication by restricting ingress traffic based on destination port and source IPs. If desired, configurations are also possible that could allow inter-VLAN communication. Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack&nbsp;Architects will work with customers to understand their needs and recommend an appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Similarly, this practice also extends down into the storage platform by leveraging the OpenStack Identity security service.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack&nbsp;separates&nbsp;management and internal service traffic onto separate networks. Management networks are secured via VPN access and hardware firewalls. OpenStack internal communications are performed as RESTful API calls that can be secured via&nbsp;the use of SSL/TLS certificates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking forward, OpenStack's security groups are actively advancing Firewall-as-a-Service and other OpenStack networking features enabling multiple levels of software defined network isolation.</p>

<h2>Operational Security</h2>

<p>Rackspace's hosting&nbsp;policies and procedures set a high standard that each employee, consultant, and third-party service provider is required to follow. These corporate standards cover key functions like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>password based access</li>
	<li>bastion server based access</li>
	<li>VPN&nbsp;based access</li>
	<li>password expiration</li>
	<li>two factor authentication to bastion and VPN servers</li>
	<li>access that are monitored and independently audited</li>
	<li>automatic workstation locking</li>
	<li>documented change management and escalation procedures</li>
	<li>onboarding training</li>
</ul>

<p>Rackspace maintains documented operational procedures for both infrastructure operations and customer-facing support functions. Newly provisioned infrastructure undergoes appropriate testing procedures to limit exposure to any hardware failure. Documented procedures and configuration version controls provide protection from errors during configuration. Changes to an existing infrastructure are controlled by a technical change management policy, which enforces best practice change management controls including impact/risk assessment, customer sign off, and back-out planning.</p>

<p>Rackspace&nbsp;participates in and maintains the following audit reports, certifications, and documentation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>SSAE 16 / ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70 Type II) Audit Reports</li>
	<li>Safe Harbor Self-Certification</li>
	<li>ISO 27001 Certification(s)</li>
	<li>PCI Attestation of Compliance &amp; PCI DSS Validated Service Provider</li>
	<li>CDSA Certification</li>
	<li>SOC2 Data Centers in Security &amp; Availability Report</li>
	<li>SOC3 Data Centers in Security &amp; Availability Report</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether the cloud is hosted at a Rackspace datacenter or at a customer's datacenter, the support team will adhere to both Rackspace's corporate as well as the customer's policies and procedures. The Rackspace team will work with customers to determine the appropriate level of access and proper delineation of responsibilities to support the Private Cloud including identifying any logistical steps needed.</p>

<p>Should a Private Cloud be deployed at a customer's or third party datacenter and supported by Rackspace, the Rackspace Support team is willing to work with customers to understand their specific security standards and derive a solution that meets or exceeds those standards.</p>

<h3>Data Security/Backup</h3>

<p>Our OpenStack private cloud&nbsp;allows 3rd party encryption tools to be used throughout the infrastructure, including SSL/TLS certifications and file/database encryption, giving customers flexibility to reuse their current encryption tools. While no solution is prescribed, Rackspace Implementation teams will work with customers to provide guidance on how to integrate these.</p>

<p>Our OpenStack private cloud&nbsp;is integrated with Rackspace Managed Backup service, giving customers the ability to securely back up Host Machine information.</p>

<p>Operationally, the OpenStack private cloud Support Team can actively monitor the cloud environment and proactively reach out to customers when actions are required. Rackspace recommends and most customers wish to provide an approval prior to any changes being made.</p>

<h2>Physical Security</h2>

<p>For OpenStack private clouds hosted at a Rackspace Data Center, physical security concerns are addressed across the data center and network.</p>

<h3>Data Center</h3>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack is available in Rackspace datacenters globally. Rackspace data centers physical security capabilities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two-factor authentication required to access all data center facilities.</li>
	<li>Electromechanical locks controlled by biometric authentication (hand geometry or fingerprint scanner) and key-card/badge.</li>
	<li>Access to secure sub-areas allocation on a role-specific basis</li>
	<li>Authorized Rackspace personnel's access to the facilities is reviewed on a monthly basis by management</li>
	<li>Termination and role-change control procedures are in place so that any physical or logical access rights are removed in a timely manner when access is no longer necessary or appropriate</li>
	<li>Closed circuit video surveillance is installed at all entrance points on the interior and exterior of the buildings that house data centers. Cameras are monitored 24x7x365 by on-site security personnel and support data retention for 90 days.</li>
	<li>Sensitive equipment such as information processing facilities, including customer servers, is housed in secure sub-areas within each data center's secure perimeter and is subject to additional controls</li>
	<li>Centralized Security Management Systems are deployed at all data centers to control the Electronic Access Control Systems and closed circuit television networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rackspace data centers are operational 24x7x365 and are manned around-the-clock by a security team and engineering/operations personnel. Appropriate additional perimeter defense measures, such as walls, fencing, gates and anti-vehicle controls are in place at Rackspace data centers. The delivery and loading bays at all Rackspace data centers are separate areas secured by defined procedures and security controls.</p>

<p>Unauthorized visitors are not permitted access to the data centers. Authorized data center visitors are required to abide by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Authorized approvers must specifically grant visitor access to the data centers at least 24 hours before the scheduled visit</li>
	<li>Visitors must have a valid reasons for entering the data center</li>
	<li>Visitors must sign the visitor's log, present a valid photo ID, and specify the reason for visiting and a Rackspace point of contact</li>
	<li>Visitor badges differ in appearance from Rackspace employee badges and do not provide any control over doors, locks, etc.</li>
	<li>All visitor access is logged. This policy applies equally to Rackspace employees not assigned to the data center.</li>
	<li>Visitors, including Rackspace customers, are strictly forbidden from accessing the data halls themselves and other secure sub areas.</li>
	<li>Visitors must be escorted at all times while at any Rackspace Facility.</li>
	<li>Data center management performs a monthly audit of security and visitor access logs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Network Security</h2>

<p>Whether deployed at Rackspace or within a customer's data center, network security is as equally important as physical security and encryption. OpenStack Neutron network component is a software defined networks that provides enhanced flexibility on how to manage your virtual network. Security over these networks can be applied in a variety of ways. Rackspace Private Cloud Architects and Support team will work with customers to help identify and develop an appropriate solution to meet their current and future needs.</p>

<h3>Network Security within a Rackspace Datacenter</h3>

<p>All Rackspace network infrastructure devices are located in a physically secure data center with controlled access. All visitors or authorized contractors are logged and escorted. Local console access to network devices is restricted to authorized individuals and requires access to the physical location as well as the correct username and password for console login. While Rackspace utilizes a wireless infrastructure for corporate connectivity, wireless access points are not permitted in the data halls where the cloud infrastructure resides and regular scans are performed to identify and neutralize rogue access points.</p>

<p>Administrative access to the networking devices underlying the cloud infrastructure is controlled via industry standard practices (TACACS+) and is subject to appropriate logging and monitoring, records of which are retained for one year. Logical access to cloud infrastructure network devices is only provided to those Rackspace employees with a business requirement for such access, and is subject to permissions change control including independent managerial authorization and timely revocation of access rights. SSL is used to encrypt administrative sessions.</p>

<p>Implementing new cloud environments is performed according to standardized procedures in order to minimize the risk of accidental insecure network provisioning.</p>

<p>Rackspace maintains strict policies on the use of network services. The network services underlying our cloud infrastructure are subject to DDoS/DoS mitigation and network policy enforcement controls, ensuring the best possible quality of connection to the customer's cloud environment and maximizing the stability of the environment. These include anti-spoofing controls and IP prefix-lists, as well as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) protocols in place at edge routers in data centers hosting cloud environments.</p>

<h2>Recommended Customer Controls</h2>

<p>When hosted at Rackspace, Rackspace infrastructure controls are designed to protect cloud resources from attack within the environment, appropriately control and provide assurance over Rackspace access to customer cloud resources. The customer should seek to protect their cloud resources and hosted data with measures overlaying Rackspace infrastructure controls as appropriate to their data's sensitivity and criticality as informed by a formal risk assessment.</p>

<p>Customers are the primary owner of their data and maintain sole visibility over its specific security requirements. Accordingly, customers are responsible for classifying their data and applying appropriate risk mitigation controls. Customer's sensitive data should be encrypted for storage in order to preserve confidentiality. Rackspace recommends that data being transmitted to and from the cloud should be subject to encryption appropriate to its requirements, for example the use of TLS or a secure VPN.</p>

<p>Our OpenStack private cloud customers can interact with the environment at an administrative level via API. Authentication&nbsp;is required in order to use them. Customer applications that interface with APIs should undergo adequate security testing and maintain best practice application security controls including communication with our SSL protected API endpoints via HTTPS. Customers should consider tightly restricting access to API keys and account credentials to those employees with a legitimate business requirement, as well as segregating duties to maintain accountability.</p>

<p>As primary system administrator of the cloud resources, the customer is responsible for managing user accounts creation, provisioning and destruction, password policies, server level account authentication mechanisms, etc. Rackspace recommends that customers integrate their Private Cloud with their organizational Single-sign on (SSO) domain if available in order to simplify this task.</p>
