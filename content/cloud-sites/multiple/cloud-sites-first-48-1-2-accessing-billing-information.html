<p><strong>Note</strong>: This article is written for our <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_self">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can get to it from the Cloud Control Panel by clicking the Cloud Control Panel menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong>.</p>

<p>After logging in to the Control Panel, you might be wondering about how billing for our Cloud Services works.</p>

<p class="p1">When using Rackspace Cloud Sites, your credit card will first be charged when you first sign up for the account. &nbsp;Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day that you activate your account. &nbsp;After 30 days have elapsed, you will then be billed for the next month of service. The exact amount may vary as it is based on recurring charges in addition to whatever one-time fees you have incurred during the previous month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article will provide you with an overview of the billing resources available to you through our website and your Control Panel. &nbsp;You can use the following resources to help you manage and track the billing for your account:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pricing pages and cost calculator</h3>

<p>Each of the product pages on our website contains the most current pricing list, and each also has a cost calculator to assist you in estimating your monthly charges. &nbsp;</p>
