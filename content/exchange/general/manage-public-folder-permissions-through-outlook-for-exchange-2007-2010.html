<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;You might see a few groups on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, and that is normal. It is important to leave these groups intact so that we can help you if you need help.&nbsp;There are also two special&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groups called <strong>FolderAdmins</strong> and <strong>FolderUsers</strong>. These groups allow you to set permissions for all of your public folder administrators or users at once.</p>	</li>
