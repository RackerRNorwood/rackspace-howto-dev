<p>Swiftly is a client tool that you can use to upload objects to and download objects from your Cloud Files account. Swiftly manages the storage of large objects in Cloud Files. If you have a very large object (such as a virtual disk image file), Swiftly splits the file into smaller segments and then creates the large object manifest for you.</p>

<h2>Install GNU Screen (optional)</h2>

<p>GNU Screen is a program that you can use to start a screen session. A screen session looks just like an ordinary shell except that you can "detach" a terminal from a screen session, and whatever commands you are running&nbsp; continue running in the session. This functionality is useful when you start a long running process (such as a large object upload) from the command line. If your laptop battery dies, or your wireless connection is lost, or you are otherwise disconnected, the process continue to run in your screen session.</p>

<h3>Install screen in Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Invoke the following command from a bash shell:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install screen
</pre>

<h3>Installing screen in CentOS</h3>

<p>Invoke the following command from a bash shell:</p>

<pre>
sudo yum install screen
</pre>

<h3>Get started with the screen program</h3>

<p>To start the screen program, run the following command. The <strong>-s</strong> option tells the program what shell to use. The <strong>-S</strong> option provides a name for the session, which is helpful if you will have several screen sessions running at the same time.</p>

<pre>
screen -s /bin/bash -S display-Name-For-Screen
</pre>

<p>After you start the screen program, you can justenter regular bash commands. Screen commands, that is, commands requesting screen to do something, are escaped with Control-a (or <strong>C-a</strong>) . Some screen commands are single character. For example, to detach from screen, you type the following command:</p>

<pre>
C-a d
</pre>

<p>Other screen commands are longer. To use these, you first type &nbsp;<strong>C-a:</strong>&nbsp; and then you type the rest of the command in the status line of the screen window. For example, you can log screen's output to a file so that you can go back and review it later by typing the following command:</p>

<pre>
C-a :
</pre>

<pre>
C-a : logfile name-of-log-file
C-a : log
</pre>

<p>The first command sets the name of the file in which the log will be recorded. The second command toggles logging on and off; because this is the first time you typed it, it will turn logging on.</p>

<p>We encourage to create a log of screen output so that you'll have a record of everything that happened while you were detached from screen.</p>

<p>To exit screen, just type <strong>Control-d</strong> (without prefacing it with <strong>Control-a</strong>).</p>

<p>You can learn more about screen by visiting <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Reattach to a running screen session</h3>

<p>You can get a list of what screen sessions you currently have running by invoking this command from a bash shell:</p>

<pre>
screen -list
</pre>

<p>Your response will look something like this:</p>

<pre>
There are screens on:
	3064.some-other-stuff	(Detached)
	3004.large-obj-transfer	(Detached)
	3073.even-more-stuff	(Detached)
3 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-root.
</pre>

<p>To reattach to the screen session named large-obj-transfer, for example, you note the session number (in this example, 3004) and then use the following command:</p>

<pre>
screen -r 3004
</pre>
