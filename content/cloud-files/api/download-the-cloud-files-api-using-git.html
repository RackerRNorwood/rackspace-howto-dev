Download Cloud Files SDKs for Different Languages

<p>You can download the language-specific software development kits (SDKs) for Cloud Files from the Rackspace Developer website at <a href="http://developer.rackspace.com/#home-sdks">http://developer.rackspace.com/#home-sdks</a>. This site includes links to the SDKs for the following languages:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>Microsoft .NET</li>
	<li>Node.js</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to links to the SDKs, this site provides links to reference materials, sample code, and tips on how to use each SDK.</p>

<h2>Using Git</h2>

<p>Some of the SDK instructions use the Git version control system. The documentation for each SDK assumes that you have Git installed and configured on your local machine. For more information about Git, see the Git website for UNIX or Linux or for Windows.</p>

<h2>Downloading an SDK</h2>

<p>To download an SDK, follow the instructions on the SDKâ€™s web page. In general, you run a git clone command with the URL of the repository that you want to get as an argument. Because the clone operation downloads the files to your current directory, you should create an empty directory to hold the files before performing the download.</p>
