<p>You can use Rackspace Intelligence to help you observe the status of your database if you set up the database to be visible to Rackspace Intelligence. You can do this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a> by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a database.&nbsp;For instructions on creating a database at the command-line by using the trove client, see <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cdb/api/v1.0/cdb-getting-started/content/Create_Cloud_Database.html">Create Your First Cloud Database</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Establish monitoring checks and alarms for the database as described in&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-cloud-databases-in-the-cloud-control-panel">Monitoring Cloud Databases in the Cloud Control Panel</a>.</li>
