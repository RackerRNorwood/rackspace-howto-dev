Open alerts report statuses that you have asked Rackspace Intelligence
to monitor but not
[suppress](/knowledge_center/article/scheduling-suppression-of-rackspace-intelligence-notifications).

You can view a list of all open alerts by clicking** Monitor** at the
top of the Rackspace Intelligence interface and then clicking **Open
Alerts**.

You can sort the list of open alerts based on the names of entities or
alarms, the status of alarms, and the time each alarm was triggered.

Sorting by status groups the most serious alarms together, which can
help you to prioritize responses.

Sorting by time reports the history of alarms in chronological or
reverse-chronological order, which can help you to investigate causes
and effects.

You can also export the list of open alerts in CSV format suitable for
further analysis. To export the list of open alerts as in CSV format,
click the **Export as CSV** link and then follow the required steps to
save the file.
