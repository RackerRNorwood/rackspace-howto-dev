<p>You can set up domains with any extension, but only the following ones can be purchased or transferred to Cloud Sites at this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>.com</li>
<li>.org</li>
<li>.net</li>
<li>.co.uk</li>
</ul>
<p>Though they can be registered in the control panel, all .uk address can only be registered for a 2 year minimum and maximum.</p>
