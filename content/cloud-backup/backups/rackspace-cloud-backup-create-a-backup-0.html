<! ----Rackspace Cloud Backup - Create a backup ---- />

<p>The following steps show how to use the Cloud Backup service to create a backup of the data on your cloud server.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use the Cloud Backup tool to back up your data files but not to back up a full operating system. To restore your data, you need to restore only your files; you do not need to restore all of the operating system files. To back up the operating system, create an image of your server. For more information about restoring a server from an image, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/create-an-image-of-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image">Create an image of a server and restore a server from a saved image</a>.</p>
