<p><strong><strong>APPLIES TO</strong></strong>: RackConnect v2.0</p>
<p><strong>What are RackConnect Automation Features?<br /></strong></p>
<p>The RackConnect Automation Features are three (3) <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-help-automation-features">Automation Features </a>that were not initially available to customers that upgraded from RackConnect 1.0, but that have always been enabled for customers who started off as RackConnect 2.0 customers.&nbsp; Enabling these Automation Features will provide the complete RackConnect 2.0 feature-set to these RackConnect 1.0 upgraded customers.&nbsp; The Automation Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provision public IP address:</strong> Automatic assignment and provisioning of a public IP address, translated through your dedicated network device, per cloud server</li>
<li><strong>Configure network stack:</strong> Automatic configuration of the cloud server network stack for use with RackConnect</li>
<li><strong>Manage software firewall:</strong> Configuration and ongoing management of the cloud server software firewall, including ACL management of cloud-specific traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>These Automation Features show you which actions the RackConnect automation system will and will not take against your environment.&nbsp; In certain cases, the settings may differ between your cloud account and your individual cloud servers.&nbsp; The cloud account settings will be used for all new cloud servers you build in the future and the pre-existing cloud server settings will be used if you perform a rebuild or make other changes to your cloud server.</p>
<p><strong>What are the pre-requisites for enabling the Automation Features on my cloud account associated with RackConnect?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You must have completed the RackConnect 1.0 upgrade process to RackConnect 2.0, since the RackConnect Automation Features are not compatible with RackConnect 1.0.</li>
<li>Your Rackspace Support Team will also need to verify that your Network Device meets the requirements for enabling the Automation Features, such as the RAM, version, and configuration requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Enabling the Automation Features, assuming you meet the requirements, should not require any downtime.&nbsp; Your Rackspace Support Team will inform you if a maintenance needs to take place, if they find that your Network Device does not meet the requirements.<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Are there any additional costs for enabling the RackConnect Automation Features?</strong></p>
<p>No, as with all RackConnect versions, RackConnect is a free service available to all Rackspace customers that meet the Network Device requirements.&nbsp; Please keep in mind that you will still have any normal charges associated with the cost of your Dedicated and Cloud environements, but there are no costs for the RackConnect service itself.</p>
<p><strong>At what level are Automation Features set?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Automation Features are set at the individual cloud account level.&nbsp; If you have multiple cloud accounts associated with your RackConnect Configuration, then each cloud account will have its own Automation Features settings. Whether a cloud server has its Automation Features enabled or disabled is determined by the status of the Automation Features at the cloud account level at the moment the cloud server is created.&nbsp; Essentially, what happens is that when cloud servers are created they inherit the Automation Features settings set at the cloud account level.</p>
<p><strong>Can I modify a single feature from within the Automation Features set?</strong></p>
<p>No, it is only possible to enable or disable all (3) Automation Features together.</p>
<p><strong>When and how can I opt-in to the Automation Features?</strong></p>
<p>These features are currently available to customers upgraded from RackConnect 1.0 on an opt-in basis.&nbsp; You may&nbsp; request these features by contacting your Rackspace Support Team.&nbsp; Here is a quick overview of the opt-in process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact your Rackspace Support Team and let them know you would like to enable the RackConnect Automation Features</li>
<li>Your Rackspace Support Team will verify that your RackConnect Configuration and Network Device(s) meet the requirements for enabling the RackConnect Automation Features</li>
<li>They will also let you know of any requirements that have not been met and will work with you to schedule any maintenance(s) that may be required</li>
<li>They will configure your environment and Network Device with the required settings</li>
<li>They will then enable the RackConnect Automation Features and let you know when the process is complete</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why don't all RackConnect 2.0 customers have their Automation Features enabled by default?<br /></strong></p>
<p>The reason that these features were not initially available to customers upgraded from RackConnect 1.0 is because of their potential to disrupt functionality that many RackConnect 1.0 users have taken advantage of.</p>
<p><strong>How will enabling/disabling the Automation Features affect new cloud server builds?</strong></p>
<p>New cloud server builds will inherit the cloud account's Automation Features settings at the instant they are created.</p>
<p><strong>How will enabling/disabling the Automation Features affect cloud server rebuilds?</strong></p>
<p>When cloud servers are rebuilt, they will use the Automation Features settings that are set at the cloud server level.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change the Automation Features set at the individual cloud server level?</strong></p>
<p>No, it is not possible to directly change the Automation Features settings for existing cloud servers.&nbsp; If the Automation Features set at the cloud account level differ from those set at your cloud server's level, and you would like them to match, the following "workaround" is the only way to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a backup/snapshot image of the existing cloud server to Cloud Files</li>
<li>Create a new cloud server from the backup image</li>
</ol>
<p>The new cloud server, upon creation, will inherit the Automation Features settings set at the cloud account level.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I check what the current Automation Features settings are for my cloud account(s)?<br /></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your account in the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/">my.rackspace.com</a> portal</li>
<li>Select "Network" -&gt; "RackConnect" to enter the RackConnect Management Interface:<br /><img class="image-full_width" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/field/image/New.RC_.Management.Interface.Navigation.png" alt="" width="700" height="239" /></li>
<li>Select your RackConnect Configuration from the left-hand pane, then select your cloud account.&nbsp; The cloud account's overview page will list your current Automation Features settings:<br /><img class="image-full_width" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/field/image/New.MyRack.Automation.Features.status.png" alt="" width="700" height="487" /></li>

</ol>
<p><strong>How will enabling the Automation Features affect my pre-existing cloud servers?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Once Automation Features are enabled on your cloud account, the features will only apply to new cloud servers created after the features were enabled.&nbsp; RackConnect will not apply any of the Automation Features to your pre-existing cloud servers, as Automation Features would be disabled for those servers at the cloud server level. Basically, this means that whenever there is a conflict between the features set at the cloud account level and those set at the cloud server level, the settings at the cloud server level will be applied.&nbsp; There are also some caveats around how Network Policies work in environments with pre-existing cloud servers, so please review the FAQ entries in this article regarding how Network Policies work.</p>
<p><strong>In an environment where the Automation Features settings at the cloud account level do not match those set at the cloud server level, how do Network Policies work?<br /></strong></p>
<p>When there is a mismatch between Automation Features settings at the cloud account and cloud server levels, it is possible to create Network Policies that are not actually valid for a given cloud server and do not actually work as expected.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have you have just enabled Automation Features at the cloud account level, but you have a pre-existing cloud server with Automation Features disabled at the cloud server level.&nbsp; Since Automation Features are enabled at the cloud account level, you will see all 5 Network Policy options as being available, but if you create a "Cloud Server(s) to Cloud Server(s)" Network Policy, it does not actually apply to the pre-existing cloud server, since the pre-existing cloud server has Automation Features disabled at the cloud server level.&nbsp; Basically, what is happening is that the RackConnect automation does not update the software firewall on the cloud server, since Automation Features are disabled at the cloud server level.&nbsp; Although, new cloud servers will be created with Automation Features enabled, since the cloud account has Automation Features enabled, so all 5 Network Policies will work normally for new cloud servers.&nbsp; We are working on adding some warnings to the my.rackspace.com portal when you attempt to create Network Policies that are not actually valid for pre-existing cloud servers, as in the above scenario.</p>
<p>Overall, we highly recommend that you deploy your environment to have Automation Features settings match at the cloud account level and cloud server level, since having different Automation Features settings between the cloud account and cloud server levels may lead to unexpected results when creating Network Policies.</p>
<p><strong>What Network Policies are available if Automation Features are disabled at the cloud account level?<br /></strong></p>
<p>When all Automation Features are disabled at the cloud account level, you are only able to create the following types of Network Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Server(s) to Dedicated</li>
<li>Cloud Server(s) to Internet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Even when Automation Features are disabled at the cloud account level, if Automation Features for pre-existing cloud servers are enabled at the cloud server level, you will still be able to see all (5) Network Policy options, but only the 2 types of Network Policies listed above will be valid for all of your cloud servers.&nbsp; If you create invalid Network Polices, they will look like they deployed correctly, but they will not actually work as expected.&nbsp; We are working on adding some warnings to the my.rackspace.com portal when you attempt to create Network Policies that are not actually valid, as in the above scenario.<em><br /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What Network Policies are available if Automation Features are enabled at the cloud account level?<br /></strong></p>
<p>When all Automation Features are enabled at the cloud account level, you will be able to create all of the available Network Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Server(s) to Dedicated</li>
<li>Cloud Server(s) to Internet</li>
<li>Cloud Server(s) to Cloud Server(s)</li>
<li>Dedicated to Cloud Server(s)</li>
<li>Internet to Cloud Server(s)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Even when Automation Features are enabled at the cloud account level, if Automation Features for pre-existing cloud servers are disabled at the cloud server level, you will still see all (5) Network Policy options as being available for those pre-existing cloud servers, but only 2 types of Network Policies "Cloud Server(s) to Dedicated" and "Cloud Server(s) to Internet" will be valid for those pre-existing cloud servers.&nbsp; If you create invalid Network Polices for these pre-existing cloud servers, they will look like they deployed correctly, but they will not actually work as expected.&nbsp; We are working on adding some warnings to the my.rackspace.com portal when you attempt to create Network Policies that are not actually valid, as in the above scenario.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Can I disable Automation Features on my cloud account associated with RackConnect?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have the ability to disable your Automation Features.&nbsp; While this would greatly limit the features you would have with RackConnect, there may be some instances where the limited automation features are preferred.&nbsp; Please submit a request to your Rackspace Support Team, if you would like to disable the Automation Features on any of your cloud accounts.</p>
<p><em>Note: If Automation Features are disabled on your cloud account, you would need to manually configure the network stack on your new cloud servers, as described in the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-10-post-upgrade-faq">RackConnect 1.0 Post-Upgrade FAQ </a>article.&nbsp; You may also need to clean up any pre-existing Network Policies that are no longer valid in an environment where Automation Features are disabled.</em></p>
<p><strong>What are periodic software firewall updates?</strong></p>
<p>As part of the automation feature&nbsp; 'manage software firewall', the RackConnect system will periodically connect to your cloud servers to verify that your software firewall rules are up-to-date and match your RackConnect Network Policies.&nbsp; In the event of multiple software firewall update failures for a cloud server, a support ticket will be automatically generated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Linux Cloud Servers only, you can create IPTables rules that are not overwritten by these periodic software firewall updates; for further details on how to accomplish this, please view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-to-prevent-rackconnect-from-overwriting-custom-iptables-rules-on-linux-cloud-servers">How to Prevent RackConnect from Overwriting Custom IPTables Rules on Linux Cloud Servers</a>.&nbsp; Software firewall modifications should only be made via the Network Policies section of the MyRackspace Portal.&nbsp; Please view the following article for further details on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-rackconnect-network-policies">Managing RackConnect Network Policies</a>.</p>
