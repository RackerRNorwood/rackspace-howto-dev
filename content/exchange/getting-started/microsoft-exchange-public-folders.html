<p>Public folders are a feature of Microsoft Exchange that are used to share information with others within your organization.&nbsp; Public folder administrators can set privileges for users to access a folder, or the folder can be made available to everyone within your organization.&nbsp; Public folders contain contacts, calendar items, messages, journal entries, or notes.</p>

<strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;You might see a few groups on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, and that is normal. It is important to leave these groups intact so that we can help you if you need help.&nbsp;There are also two special groups called FolderAdmins and FolderUsers. These groups allow you to set permissions for all of your public folder administrators or users at once.</p>
