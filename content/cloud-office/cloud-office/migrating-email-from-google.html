<p>When you migrate your email from Google, it is important to note that Google email does not use sub-folders. &nbsp;Instead, Google categorizes email by using "labels."&nbsp; As a result, some migration services must convert the Google labels into sub-folders. &nbsp;When you use MigrationWiz to migrate your email, the conversion happens seamlessly in the background. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to labels, Google has a folder called <strong>All Mail</strong>, which contains a copy of every message in your mailbox. By default, MigrationWiz only migrates archived email within the <strong>All Mail</strong> folder.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More items to note:</strong></p><ul><li>After the migration, you might see a new folder called <strong>All Mail</strong>.&nbsp;The view and folder structure will be similar to that in Google. &nbsp;</li><li>The size of the email account might be larger because of the <strong>All Mail</strong> folder. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
