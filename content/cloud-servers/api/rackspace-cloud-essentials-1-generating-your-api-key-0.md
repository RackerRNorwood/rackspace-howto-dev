The [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com/) is a GUI tool for accessing all of your Rackspace services, but there might be times when you want to manage your assets through a scripting interface like the application programming interface (API). See our [catalog of APIs](http://docs.rackspace.com/) for reference.

Before you can start using Rackspace APIs, you need to have your API key. Your API key is a unique alphanumeric identifier associated with your account that is used for universal authentication commands for all of your services.

## To view or regenerate your API key

1.	In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the **Account:** ***userName***  menu and select **Account Settings**.

2.	To view your API key, click on the link labeled **Show** next to **API Key**. You can copy and paste the API key from this screen.

3.	To create a new API key, click the **Reset** link. A confirmation window is displayed.

4.	Click **Generate New Key** to confirm.

    Your new key is displayed.


**Note:** When you regenerate your API key, any third-party applications are disconnected until you set the new API key in your application. If you are using your API key as a part of a server code with a site or application, the site or application will also break and could potentially affect your day-to-day operations. We recommend updating your API key for any application you had connected with the previous API key.


## Where to go from here

Now that you have viewed or regenerated your API key, continue with the rest of the tour of the Cloud Control Panel with an [Overview of the Billing Services](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/Billing_Services) available to you.
