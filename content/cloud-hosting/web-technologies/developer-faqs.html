<h3><a name="what_is"></a>What is the developer+™ program?</h3>

<p>developer+ is an introductory program for developers that enables them to experience Fanatical Support® and grow with Rackspace toward adoption of the managed cloud.</p>

<p>The Service Level Rate and Service Level minimums are removed for customers participating in the program. They are provided with an infrastructure credit of $50 a month for 12 months that covers a base set of services. As with all Rackspace customers, participants in developer+ are provided the following services at no charge: Cloud DNS, Cloud Orchestration, Cloud Monitoring, Mailgun™ (first 50,000 emails free), and Cloud Networking. Some support options in the customer portal have been removed for developer+ customers, such as one-to-one chat, support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with Billing Inquiries.</p>

<p>As new products and services come online, they might be added to and highlighted in this program.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms as part of the terms and conditions of signup that allow our teams to get direct, honest feedback from customers. This feedback will enable us to examine our offerings, documentation, user experience, and more.</p>

<h3><a name="difference"></a>What is the difference between developer+™ and the Startup Program?</h3>

<p>developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and deploying their code and require minimal assistance to use the Rackspace Cloud</p>

<p>The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a service and leverages Rackspace’s knowledge and experience in the business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice on how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also connects entrepreneurs to tools like ObjectRocket™ and Mailgun™, and gives them access to guidance on their startup through our extensive network of startup and technology business professionals.</p>

<h3><a name="identified"></a>How is developer+ identified in the different Service Levels?</h3>

<p>Customers in the developer+™ program are a part of the Managed Infrastructure service level, but have limited access to support Rackers and have a customized self-service view.</p>

<p>Additionally, we offer developer-to-developer online support, which is delivered to developers in a way they are used to and expect. Developer-to-developer differs from online support only in scope and location--it is still the exceptional customer experience delivered by Fanatical Support that customers expect from Rackspace.</p>

<p>The following features are part of developer+:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An enriched developer portal, developer guides and a continually improved developer experience based on direct feedback</li>
	<li>Rackspace Developer-to-Developer and troubleshooting support from our experts for your code leveraging our interfaces (APIs and SDKs)</li>
	<li>IRC (join us in #rackspace on irc.freenode.net)</li>
	<li>StackOverflow Community Forums, email, Hacker News, and other online communities<br />
	<strong>Note:</strong> Tickets filed are limited to billing only</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="add_service"></a>What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or database?</h3>

<p>developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume" price for all services in any region at our adjusted infrastructure prices. They can consume ObjectRocket™, OnMetal™--everything currently available to our other customers.<br />

<h3><a name="upgrade"></a>Can developers upgrade to another service level?</h3>

<p>At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel and upgrade to our Managed Cloud service levels. Customers may not, however, switch to developer+.<br />
