<h3 class="title topictitle1">Checking system load</h3>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">If the demands being placed on a <a class="xref" href="/knowledge_center/content/checking-running-services-linux">running program</a> cause it to request excessive resources from your server this can lead to poor performance and system instability.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic concept nested0" id="concept_yy3_4hv_ng">
<h3 class="title topictitle1">Uptime</h3>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">First let's check the load on your server using the uptime command.</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">
$ uptime
15:16:45 up 41 days,  2:35,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 3.01, 2.70
</pre>

<p class="p">The example shows the output from uptime. When the command was run at 15:16:45 the server had been up for 41 days 2 hours and 35 minutes, there were two users logged on and the load averages were 0.01, 3.01 and 2.70.</p>

<p class="p">The load average represents the work being done by the system.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The three numbers show the load averages for the last minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A load average of 1&nbsp;reflects the full workload of a single processor on the system. A</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;load of 2 on a system with two CPUs</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;means that those</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;CPUs were working at maximum.&nbsp;On</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;a system with four CPUs, that&nbsp;2 reflects a workload using&nbsp;about half of the available processing power.</span></p>

<p class="p">Under normal circumstances you'll want the load average to be 70% of your total CPU usage or less. You can check the number of CPUs available to your instance by running the following command:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">
grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
</pre>

<p class="p">If the load averages show that the load is increasing and is above the number of CPUs, you should look into the&nbsp;cause of&nbsp;the high load. A load above the number of CPUs&nbsp;means that the system is having to queue up processor requests, which reduces&nbsp;performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic concept nested0" id="concept_cyr_phv_ng">
<h3 class="title topictitle1">top</h3>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">The <code>top</code> command displays real time information regarding the server's resource usage. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="/knowledge_center/index.php/System_Monitoring_with_top">our guide</a> for a more in-depth look at using this tool. The first few lines will give you a summary of the resource utilisation on your system and you can sort the list of processes by CPU (P) or memory (M) use which allows you to quickly see where your server is receiving the biggest demands on its resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic concept nested0" id="concept_1gm_qhv_ng">
<h3 class="title topictitle1">vmstat</h3>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">The amount of memory a system has is one of the most common restraining factors. The swap is an area of the hard drive where data is moved to free up physical memory (RAM) for a process to use (not all servers have swap space configured). A system using its swap area does not necessarily mean it is low on memory, but if most of your system’s swap is being consumed it could indicate that your server is trying to do more than its available memory permits.</p>

<p class="p">If swap space is configured and you suspect your server is running out of standard memory, you can use vmstat to show how much swapping is occurring.</p>

<p class="p">The following example displays a system’s virtual memory statistics 10 times at 5 second intervals.</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">
$ vmstat 5 10

<p class="p">In the example the <code>free</code> column shows that the amount of free memory is only around 4MB.</p>

<p class="p">The <code>si</code> and <code>so</code> columns show the amount of data being transferred between the system’s swap and its memory. In this example you can see there is lots of data being moved. <code>so</code> is the amount of data being moved to the swap to free up memory. <code>si</code> is the amount of data being pulled from the swap back in to memory. This happens when the data is required for a process to run.</p>

<p class="p">When a server is constantly swapping into and out of memory it is an indication that the load it is being placed under is too great for the resources it has available. top can be used to help identify the processes that are consuming the most resources.</p>

<h3 class="title topictitle1">Summary</h3>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">If top and vmstat indicate that the server is using all its resources you need to look at optimising your current set up – this can include running any processing jobs outside peak hours, killing any processes no longer required and reconfiguring processes so they require less resources. You may also want to consider increasing the size of your server to better match your requirements.</p>

<p class="p">Assuming your application is running and looks healthy, let’s now check that it is listening for network connections. We can see if the service is listening on the correct socket using the netstat command, which we'll cover in the <a class="xref" href="/knowledge_center/content/checking-listening-ports-netstat">next article in this series</a>.</p>
