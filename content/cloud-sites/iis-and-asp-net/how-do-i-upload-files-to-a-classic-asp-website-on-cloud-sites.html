<p>In order to do this 2 pieces of information are required.</p><ol><li>The data center location of the website ( ORD or DFW ) ( If website test link contains 'dfw' the site is assigned to DFW, otherwise it is ORD)</li><li>The web directory into which the files are uploaded. This is obtained from the features tab and would look like <strong>\\fs1-n01\stor1wc1dfw1\300000\asp.example.com\web\content\upload</strong></li></ol><p><br /> Once the information is available use the following 2 asp files as references to upload files. The USERNAME and PASSWORD in UploadScript1.asp are the same as those used for impersonation. (Refer to <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_add_impersonation_to_my_ASP.NET_site%3F" title="How do I add impersonation to my ASP.NET site?">How do I add impersonation to my ASP.NET site?</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>test1.asp</li></ul><pre> &lt;HTML&gt;
 &lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"&gt;

 &lt;FORM METHOD="POST" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="UploadScript1.asp"&gt;
 &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE SIZE=60 NAME="FILE1"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE SIZE=60 NAME="FILE2"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE SIZE=60 NAME="FILE3"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 &lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Upload!"&gt; &lt;/FORM&gt;

 &lt;/BODY&gt;
 &lt;/HTML&gt;

 </pre><ul><li>UploadScript1.asp</li></ul><pre> &lt;HTML&gt;
 &lt;BODY&gt;

 &lt;%
  Set Upload = Server.CreateObject("Persits.Upload.1")
  Upload.LogonUser "ord", "USERNAME", "PASSWORD"

  Count = Upload.Save("\\fsvs02\target02\WindowsPathInFeaturesTab\upload")
 %&gt;
 &lt;% = Count&nbsp;%&gt; files uploaded.

 &lt;/BODY&gt;
 &lt;/HTML&gt;
 </pre><p>Please note that if your Cloud Site is located in the DFW datacenter the Upload.LogonUser line would need to be altered as follows:</p><pre>Upload.LogonUser "dfw", "USERNAME", "PASSWORD"
</pre><p>Please also note that the credentials you use here must be those of the <strong>Primary FTP account</strong>. Secondary FTP accounts will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> work!</p>
