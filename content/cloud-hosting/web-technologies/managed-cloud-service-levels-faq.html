<h3><a name="devops"></a>What is the DevOps Automation service?</h3>

<p>The DevOps Automation service provides <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/devops/automation-service/">managed support for DevOps tools</a> that help you automate the process of deploying and scaling applications. Although this service can be used by anyone, it is ideal when you need to scale up infrastructure quickly or will have the need to scale up infrastructure in the future. Here are some cases for this service:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Enforce consistency</strong>: Create identical development, staging, and testing environments based on the same configurations.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration management</strong>: Get the right balance of base images and instance configuration at build time, which simplifies image management and instance building across infrastructure types.</li>
	<li><strong>Change management</strong>: Adhere to strict source control practices for your environment, so that any changes can always be audited, tracked, and reversed if needed.</li>
	<li><strong>Respond to alerts</strong>: Our team configures the monitoring, manages the environment, and responds to alerts as they occur so that your team can focus on your application.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="choose"></a>Can new public-cloud customers choose other service levels?</h3>

<p>No, new customers can choose <em>only</em> between Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations. Customers with the previous pricing model can stay on that model or they may choose to move to the new pricing model. Customers cannot return to the old model after they upgrade to Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations service levesl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="old_infra"></a>What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?</h3>

<p>Customers who have the Infrastructure Service Level will be grandfathered into their current pricing plan and will continue to receive the same support as always, along with the enhancements that we’re announcing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="improving"></a>Is Rackspace improving the support experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, we are always looking at ways to improve our support. We expect that our pricing changes will cause some new customers who don’t value support to choose other providers. As a result, we will be able to shift more resources to serve customers who do value support and are willing to pay for it.</p>

<h3><a name="guarantees"></a>What support guarantees do customers receive with Managed Cloud?</h3>

<p><strong>Support SLA</strong>: A service level agreement (SLA)&nbsp;that covers support circumstances within our control.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Credit percentage: Standard rate is 5 percent per every 30 minutes of downtime, up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2x SLA Accelerator Credit percentage</strong>: For Managed Operations service level customers, we will double the credit percentage of all applicable SLA violations.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Credit percentage: 2x up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend. For example, if the standard payout is 5 percent per 30 minutes of downtime, Managed Operations will be 10 percent per 30 minutes.</li>
	<li>This 2x accelerator also applies to Support SLA credit payouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10x SLA Accelerator Credit Payout for Planned Events for Managed Operations. </strong>Limited availability and subject to certain restrictions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Managed Operations customers who, in preparation for a high traffic event, undergo a Rackspace&nbsp;led architecture review and meet the minimum requirements are eligible for this SLA.</li>
	<li>The customer must notify Rackspace at least 30 business days prior to the planned event. We provide recommendations that the customer institutes, than the&nbsp;customer signs a program agreement.</li>
	<li>Credit payout: 10x up to 200 percent of monthly spend (up to one event per month). For example, if the standard payout is 5 percent per 30 minutes, it will become 50 percent per 30 minutes up to 200 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
