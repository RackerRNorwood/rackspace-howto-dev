<p><strong>Registering a New Domain Name</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;<em>If you are registering a new domain name through the Control Panel, the DNS will automatically be setup for you to point to the Rackspace Cloud.</em><span> <em>Please see the "<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/what-top-level-domain-extensions-can-i-purchase-through-the-control-panel" target="_self">What Top Level Domain extensions can I purchase through the control panel?"</a> article for a list of domain extensions available for purchase.</em></span></p>

	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Click <strong>Add a Site</strong></li>
	<li>Select the correct <strong>Site Owner</strong> (usually "You")</li>
	<li>Next, enter the domain name you want to purchase in the "Domain Name" text box (i.e. www.yourdomain.com)
	<p><img alt="" src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/namesite.png" /></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the length of time for which you want to purchase the domain name <a href="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/registerdomain.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Click here to view full size image" border="2" src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/registerdomain.png" title="Click here to view full size image" width="550" /></a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The next screen will allow you to review your new domain purchase order. If you are ready to purchase, then click <strong>Finish</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="transfer_domain" name="transfer_domain"></a></p>

<p><strong>Transferring Your Existing Domain</strong></p>

<p>With Cloud Sites, you can transfer an existing .com, .net, .org, .us, and .co.uk domain and receive an additional year of ownership for only $10.&nbsp; By transferring your registrar, you will have all of your domain information accessible in one place which makes it possible for us to help you with the renewal of the domain name and other Support issues.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Transferring your existing domain does not automatically update the DNS at the domain registrar level. You will need to manually update your DNS if you would like to make your domain live on The Rackspace Cloud.</em></p>

<p>Follow these steps to transfer your existing domain name to Cloud Sites:</p>

<h6>For a New Site:</h6>

<ul>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Rackspace Cloud Control Panel</a></li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites </strong>
	<p><img alt="" border="2" height="287" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/capture_1_0.png" width="179" /></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Click Add A Site and then enter the domain name in the <strong>Domain Name</strong> text box

	<p><img alt="" src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/namesite.png" /></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Check the <strong>I already own/manage this domain name</strong> check box</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Transfer the domain name</strong> from the pull-down menu
	<p><img alt="" src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/transferdomain.png" /></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Click <strong>Next Step</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Last, you will review your order and click <strong>Finish</strong> once you are ready to process the order</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Your current registrar may offer "transfer lock" or a similar service as a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfer of your domain name. If this feature is activated, you will need to log on to your account with your current registrar in order to unlock the domain. If you try to transfer a domain that still has the transfer lock enabled, the transfer will be denied by your current registrar. In order to turn the transfer lock function off, you must have access to the administrative email address you used when first registering the domain. Your current registrar will send an email to this account that will require a reply from you, confirming that the transfer is authorized. If you do not have access to this email address, contact&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/support/" rel="nofollow" title="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do">customer support</a>&nbsp;for help. You can do a WHOIS search to find the administrative email and the current registrar for the domain. See&nbsp;<a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_do_a_WHOIS_search%3F" title="How do I do a WHOIS search?">How do I do a WHOIS search?</a>&nbsp;for more information.</em></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>All DNS changes take up to 48 hours to take effect. During this time you can check your website by <a href="/knowledge_center/article/how-can-i-test-a-website-before-i-transfer-the-domain-name">using the test URL</a> (i.e. www.yourdomain.com.websitetestlink.com).</em></p>

	<li>Click the domain you wish to transfer</li>
