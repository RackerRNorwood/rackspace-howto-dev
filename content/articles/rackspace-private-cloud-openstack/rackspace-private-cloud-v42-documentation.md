**NOTE**: With the release of Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by
OpenStack (RPCO) v11.0 we are announcing the end-of-support for
RPCO v4.2 (Havana). Customers who are still on this legacy platform are
encouraged to work with the RPCO teams to upgrade to a supported version
of the offering. Benefits of doing so include additional features and
services, bug fixes and ongoing security patching. 

Rackspace Private Cloud v4.2.2 and earlier use Chef to create an
OpenStack cluster on Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The
installation scripts provide a familiar approach for Linux system
administrators, and can be updated easily without downloading and
installing a new ISO.

Two v4 versions are available:

-   Rackspace Private Cloud v4.2.2, based on OpenStack Havana ([Release
    Notes](http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v4/rackspace-private-cloud-releasenotes-v4-2/content/rpc-common-front.html))
-   Rackspace Private Cloud v4.1.5, based on OpenStack Grizzly ([Release
    Notes](http://docs.rackspace.com/rpc/api/v4/rackspace-private-cloud-releasenotes-v4/content/overview.html))
