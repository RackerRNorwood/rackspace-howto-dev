		To check that the program is running we will start by using the command 'service'. You can use service to start, stop, and check status for an application that has an init script installed.

				The service command references a service using its init script, stored in the /etc/init.d directory. Check that directory if you aren't sure what name the system uses for a service.

				Some names vary depending on your distribution - apache is 'httpd' on CentOS, for exampe, while it's 'apache2' on Ubuntu.

			In the example above httpd cannot be started because something is already listening on the port. To find out what it is you can run netstat.

			We will cover netstat in more detail <a class="xref" href="/knowledge_center/content/checking-listening-ports-netstat">later in this series</a> but for this example it is enough to know that it can be used to display a list of listening programs and the ports they are using.

		<p class="p">
			The output from netstat shows that nc (listed in the 'Program name' column) is listening on port 80 (in the 'Local Address' column) and so stopping it should allow httpd to be started.
		</p>
		<p class="p">
			Remember that if the service isn’t running it may be that a super-server, such as xinetd, is being used to launch the program when a connection is received.

			If the service wasn’t running, starting it may have resolved the issue. Let's give it a test to find out.

		<p class="p">
			If the program is running you should see something similar to the following when you check it with service:
		</p>
		<pre class="pre codeblock">$ sudo service xinetd status
xinetd (pid  8795) is running...
</pre>
		<p class="p">
			If you cannot start your application take a look at your logs to see if they contain further information regarding the issue. This guide should help with making use of your logs.
