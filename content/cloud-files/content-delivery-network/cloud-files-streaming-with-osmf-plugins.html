<p>Streaming allows users to serve their content directly from Akamai edge servers, rather than downloading full files before they are veiwable.&nbsp; Using the OSMF plugins let developers make their own Adobe Flash players, giving them the flexibility to customize and brand them as they wish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://mediapm.edgesuite.net/akamai-osmf-plugins/samples/" target="_blank">Advanced Streaming Plugin for OSMF</a>.</p>

<p>Since OSMF plugins allow you to develop your own Flash video player and embed it as needed into your website, Rackspace does not have step-by-step instructions.&nbsp; If you are looking for a player that does not require development by your team, try our <a href="/knowledge_center/article/cloud-files-streaming-with-flowplayer-plugins">FlowPlayer plugins for Streaming over the Akamai CDN</a>.</p>
