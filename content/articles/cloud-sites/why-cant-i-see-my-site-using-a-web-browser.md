If you have uploaded new content and can't see the changes in your web
site, check the following:

1. Has it been at least 48 hours since you completed your domain
registration? If not, try uploading content to your website using the
test FTP (ftp1.ftptoyoursite.com) and checking the changes on your test
website. [Click
here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/using-a-staging-url)
for instructions on how to use your test website. 

2. Have you put files in the correct folders on the server? See [Where
should I put my web content
files?](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-uploading-your-content "/knowledge_center/index.php/Where_should_I_put_my_web_content_%28files%29%3F")
for more information.

3. Did you upload the files in the [appropriate
format?](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/should-i-upload-files-as-ascii-or-binary "/knowledge_center/index.php/Should_I_upload_files_as_ASCII_or_binary%3Fappropriate")

4. Did you [check your
nameservers](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-rackspace-nameservers-and-creating-custom-nameservers)
to make sure that they are pointing to Rackspaces nameservers? 

If you have checked these points without success, [contact

for more help.
