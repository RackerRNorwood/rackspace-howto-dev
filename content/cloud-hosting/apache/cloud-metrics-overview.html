<p>Rackspace Metrics is a multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that offers a flexible and affordable platform for storing and serving time-series metrics. It provides a REST API for metrics ingestion and retrieval. In addition, it also provides out-of-box integration with popular open source tools. The software that powers this service is an open source project named 'Blueflood', which is built on top of <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a>. Rackspace Metrics is designed to meet the functional and performance requirements of enterprise-scale metrics.</p>

<h2><a id="theGrowthofMetrics" name="theGrowthofMetrics"></a>The growth of metrics</h2>

<p>The number of applications that are built for the cloud and deployed in the cloud is growing. Instead of having a monolithic design, these applications have a distributed architecture and are deployed as clusters of platform components. These components constantly communicate with each other to form the business functions of the application. In this distributed architecture, each platform component instance is an independent process and can be monitored individually. As a result, the size of the data collected by infrastructure-monitoring tools, such as Cloud Monitoring and Nagios, has grown exponentially.</p>

<p>That’s where Rackspace Metrics comes in.</p>

<p>Rackspace Metrics focuses on changing the cost-structure of metrics collection by replacing the storage component. Metrics storage is challenging to manage because of its constantly growing size and performance requirements. Rackspace Metrics meets this challenge by aligning itself with popular open-source tools for data collection and visualization. Users get the same experience with a familiar toolset without the hassle of managing the metrics storage.</p>

<h2><a id="cloudmetricsComponents" name="cloudmetricsComponents"></a>Rackspace Metrics components</h2>

<p>Rackspace Metrics consists of two components: <strong>metrics ingestion</strong> and <strong>metrics query</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Metrics ingestion</strong>: Rackspace Metrics enables users to ingest metrics via a public API, the Ingestion API. Rackspace Metrics is integrated with popular open-source metrics collection system, such as StatsD, collectD and Logstash. Users who are new to Rackspace Metrics can start using Rackspace Metrics by changing only a few lines of configuration in their existing metrics collection systems. You can also choose to leave your existing metrics storage engine running for a while to compare against Rackspace Metrics.<br />
	<br />
	The Metrics Ingestion API is currently in the <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cmet/api/v1.0/cmet-gettingstarted/content/Early_Access_Program.html">Early Access Program</a> (EAP).<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Metrics query</strong>: Rackspace Metrics enables users to retrieve metrics data via a public API. Through its Query API, Rackspace Metrics supports metrics visualization in the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel and Cloud Intelligence for data collected through Cloud Monitoring. In addition, Rackspace Metrics can also integrate with Graphite and Grafana. See the following blog post for details: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/use-grafana-for-all-of-your-monitoring-data-rackspace-or-otherwise/">http://www.rackspace.com/blog/use-grafana-for-all-of-your-monitoring-data-rackspace-or-otherwise/</a><br />
	<br />
	The Rackspace Metrics Query API is currently in Limited Availability.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="howtoGrantUsersaccss" name="howtoGrantUsersaccss"></a>How to grant users access to Rackspace Metrics</h2>

<p>No registration is required to access data in Rackspace Metrics that has been collected through Cloud Monitoring. The data is already available to users through the Query API.&nbsp; When accessing data through the Query API, a user must have the appropriate role.</p>

<p>To obtain access to the Rackspace Metrics Ingestion API, sign up through <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/cmet/api/v1.0/cmet-gettingstarted/content/Early_Access_Program.html">Early Access Program</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>To add the role:</strong></h3>

<p>Currently Rackspace Metrics product is not available in <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Cloud Control Panel</a>.&nbsp; When you sign up for the EAP, Rackspace Metrics related roles will be added to your users automatically. If you see permission-related issues in testing, please let us know.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
