The following article will demonstrate how to create a Group List(s). A
Group List(s) can be used to email a large quantity of people by
assigning them to a parent email list. Let's take a look at how to set
this up:

 

1.  First thing you'll do is login into the Email and Apps control panel
    and select **Manage Group Lists** under the Rackspace Email product
    box.

3.  Next, enter in a name for your **Group List** email address,

    you to either **send replies to the sender only**, or **send replies
    to the entire group list**.
