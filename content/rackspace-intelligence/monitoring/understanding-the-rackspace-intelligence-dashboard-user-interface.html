<p>Rackspace Intelligence monitors the performance and availability of infrastructure and, when limits are exceeded, can respond by&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-rackspace-intelligence-notification-plans">notifying someone</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/scheduling-suppression-of-rackspace-intelligence-notifications">suppressing notification</a>.</p>

<p>When you&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-into-the-rackspace-intelligence-dashboard">log in to Rackspace Intelligence</a>, you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="453" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/intelligence-dashboard-overview.png" width="895" /></p>

<p>The dashboard provides a main overview of all of your monitoring activities.</p>

<p>You can also examine different aspects of how Rackspace Intelligence is configured to monitor your system by accessing the following sections from the header:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monitor</li>
	<li>Suppress</li>
	<li>Notify</li>
	<li>Visualize</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the offerings in that section. For example, in the Monitor&nbsp;section, you can choose to work with&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence">entities</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-open-alerts-with-rackspace-intelligence">open alerts</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="103" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/intelligence-dashboard-top-bar.png" width="738" /></p>

<p>In some areas of the interface, an&nbsp;<strong>Actions</strong>&nbsp;menu is available. For example, if you&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence#create-entities">create an entity</a> in the Monitor section and provide basic information about it, the entity details page contains an&nbsp;<strong>Actions</strong>&nbsp;menu. You can use the commands on the menu to rename the entity, define an IP address for the entity, delete the entity, and create checks or suppressions for the entity.</p>

<p>By understanding the structure of these sections in the Rackspace Intelligence interface, you can predict where to find the information and tools that you need.</p>
