This article explains how to set up a General Purpose cloud server
through the Cloud Control Panel interface. For more information about
General Purpose servers, see [What is new with General Purpose Cloud
Servers](http://rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/what-is-new-with-performance-flavors).

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel.](https://mycloud.rackspace.com)\
      
2.  [Create a server from a saved image](#fromsavedimage), or [create a
    new server](#createnew).
    -   To create a server from a previously saved image,
        select **Servers \> Saved Images**. Click the gear icon next to
        the image that you want to use to create the server, and select
        **Create Server with Image**. Skip to step 3.\

    -   To create a new server, select **Cloud Servers \> Create
        Servers**, and then click **Create Server**.\
          

3.  In the **Server Details** section of the Create Servers page, enter
    a name for your server in the **Server Name** field.\
      
4.  From the **Region** menu, select the region where you want the
    server to reside.\
     \
     For example, select **Chicago (ORD)** to house the server in a data
    center in Chicago, Illinois, USA, or select **Sydney (SYD)** for a
    data center in Sydney, Australia.\
      
5.  Under **Image**select which OS you want to uset. If you are creating
    the server from a saved image, the image is already selected.\
      
6.  In the **Flavor** section, select the flavor class and specific
    flavor for your server.\

    choose the networks to which your server will be connected.
    Click **Select Networks**.\
      
8.  Click **Create Server**.\
      
9.  When your root admin password is displayed, copy the password to a
    secure location, and then click **Dismiss Password**.\

    can then log in to it by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or SSH,
    depending on your server's OS.
