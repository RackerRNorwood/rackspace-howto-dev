 The Billing section of your existing control panel will be transitioned
into our new unified control panel. This is a first step towards
incorporating Cloud Sites into the unified control panel.
1. **Why have my billing pages disappeared from the Cloud control
panel?**

Through this change, the Cloud Control Pane&rsquo;s access to credit cards
has been consolidated, and the billing pages have been moved to the&lsquo;Rackspace Open Cloud Control Pane&rsquo;.
2. **How do I access my billing pages?**

Click on the Billing link present under your account in the 'Cloud
Control Panel'
([https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/)) and
you will be taken to the billing pages present in the&lsquo;Rackspace Open
Cloud Control Panel'
([https://mycloud.rackspace.com/](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/)) where
you will be able to perform all the billing related activities. The
Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel will open up in a new window or tab
without closing your current window.

3. **How do I get back to the original Cloud Control Panel after I am
done with viewing the Billing pages?**

Once you close the current 'Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel' window,
you should have the&lsquo;Cloud Control Pane&rsquo; window open in your browser.
