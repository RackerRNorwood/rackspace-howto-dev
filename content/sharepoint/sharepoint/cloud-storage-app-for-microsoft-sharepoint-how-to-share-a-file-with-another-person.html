<p>The Rackspace Cloud Files platform enables you to generate temporary URLs that you can use to grant others access to objects within your Cloud Files account for the amount of time that you specify. The Rackspace Cloud Storage App <em>for Microsoft SharePoint</em> implements this functionality.</p>

<h2>Generating a temporary URL</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Within the app, navigate to a container.
	<p><img alt="" height="190" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Fig%20--%20Share%20Icon.jpg" width="447" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Click the share icon on the far right of one of the files in the container.
	<p><img alt="" height="212" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Fig%20--%20Share%20Dialog.jpg" width="448" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the number of days that you want the link to be active, and click <strong>Get Link</strong>. The link is active until the date shown in the dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can then copy the link from the text box and send it to anyone with whom you want to share the file. When a browser navigates to the provided URL, the user is prompted to download the associated file.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
