<p>You can use various methods to change your FTP password. This article provides instructions for two recommended methods.</p>

</ol>

<p>An email with instructions for resetting your password is sent to the email address associated with your user name. Your new password will be required to log in to the Cloud Sites Control Panel and to upload content to your site via FTP.</p>

<h2>Change your password regularly</h2>

<p>Use this recommended method if you are updating your password as a regular security practice and have no trouble logging in to the Classic Cloud Control Panel.</p>
