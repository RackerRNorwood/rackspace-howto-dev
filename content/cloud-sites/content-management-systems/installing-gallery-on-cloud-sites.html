<h2><span class="mw-headline">Getting Started </span></h2>
<p>If you have not already done so, goto <a class="external free" title="http://gallery.menalto.com/" href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gallery.menalto.com/</a> and download the latest stable release of Gallery.</p>
<p>Here is the link that was current at the time of this article:</p>
<pre>http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=7130&amp;filename=gallery-2.3-typical-en.zip

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Setting up the Sites </span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Create your new domain from the Cloud Sites Control Panel with minimum requirements being PHP 4, and MySQL 4 or 5. If you need assistance, you can go here: <a class="new" title="How do I add a website? (page does not exist)" href="/knowledge_center/index.php?title=How_do_I_add_a_website%3F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">How do I add a website?</a></li>
<li>Once the domain has finished creating, create your database. To do this, click on the ‘Features’ tab from the top menu. Click ‘Add’, and then select ‘MySQL 4 or 5’. Type in whatever name you would like to call the DB, type in a username and password of your choice. Follow prompts to finish creation. (You may want to write down the information provided, the hostname, database name, database username and, database password.)</li>
</ol>
<p><a id="Prepare_your_data" name="Prepare_your_data"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prepare your data </span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Extract the content of the Gallery file you downloaded earlier to your local computer.</li>
<li>Open up your FTP client software and login to your new domain. If you are not familiar with uploading content, go here: <a title="What FTP software should I use?" href="/knowledge_center/index.php/What_FTP_software_should_I_use%3F">What FTP software should I use?</a> and use the information to connect provided here: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-ftpsshfsftp-clients">Getting Started With Cloud Sites, FTP/SSHFS/FTP Clients</a> . Your best bet will be to upload everything inside the ‘gallery’ folder contained within the .zip file you downloaded to your web/content folder.</li>
<li>Once the files have finished uploading, you are ready to get started with the installation of the Gallery and its settings.</li>
</ol>
<p><a id="Configure_the_Site" name="Configure_the_Site"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Configure the Site</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>The information needed here is provided when you created your Database, if did you not already write them down, you can view this by logging into your Cloud Sites Control Panel and select your domain from the list. Click on the features tab and select the database from the list. After you click it, you will see all the info you need, except for the password. This is only known to you.</li>
<li>Fill in the DB Hostname: with the hostname you now have. DB Username: with the database username you created, Fill in DB Password: with the password you created, Fill in DB Name: with the database name you created as well. Once you have filled in those fields, click Continue to Step 6.</li>
<li>The admin account username and password for Gallery will be auto generated. Make sure to write this down because you will need it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click Start Using Gallery.</li>
</ol>
<p><a id="Success" name="Success"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Success </span></h2>
<p>You have now successfully installed Gallery. Please keep in mind that this is a very much used and known PHP application, just like any well used software it is susceptible to exploit. The best way to protect yourself and your data is to update your software regularly, I recommend joining their mailing list, this will keep you up to date on releases and security problems, so you can react accordingly.</p>
