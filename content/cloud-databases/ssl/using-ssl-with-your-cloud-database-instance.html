<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol that uses encryption technology to ensure that sensitive information sent over the Internet is protected. Users on your site might need to divulge personal information to you such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, user names, and passwords. By making an SSL connection to your database, your customers can trust that their data will be encrypted when it's sent to and from your web application.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Using SSL encryption is resource-intensive and might impact the latency of your database connection.</p>

<h2>Download the CA certificate</h2>

<p>Cloud Databases configures your database instance to support the use of SSL when the instance is provisioned. To encrypt data in transit using SSL, your database connections will need to use an SSL certificate associated with Cloud Databases.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;All database instances created before October 20, 2014,&nbsp;should be restarted before accepting SSL connections.</p>

<p><a href="http://ssl.rackspaceclouddb.com/ca-cert.pem">Download the SSL certificate</a> from the following URL:</p>

<pre>
http://ssl.rackspaceclouddb.com/ca-cert.pem
</pre>

<p>Your applications should use the downloaded&nbsp;certificate as the CA certificate for SSL connections to your&nbsp;database.</p>

<h3>Use the certificate with the mysql client</h3>

<p>To make SSL connections using the <code>mysql</code> command line client, specify the location of the certificate when you start the client:</p>

<pre>
mysql â€”ssl-ca=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
</pre>

<p>More information about using SSL with MySQL can be found in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/using-ssl-connections.html" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6 documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Require SSL connections</h2>

<p>You can also set up restrictions on a user to require SSL when communicating with the database. MySQL supports the <code>GRANT</code> statement modifier <code>REQUIRE SSL</code>. For example, to restrict <code>database_user</code> to have read, write, and delete permissions for&nbsp;<code>prod_database</code> only when connected with an SSL connection, log in to MySQL as root and then issue the following command.</p>

<pre>
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON prod_database.* TO 'database_user'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If the user already exists, you must revoke all existing privileges for the user and then use the preceding&nbsp;<code>GRANT</code>&nbsp;statement to give the appropriate privileges to the user.</p>

<p>Remember to run a&nbsp;<code>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</code>&nbsp;for the database&nbsp;to make the privilege change&nbsp;take effect.</p>
