<h3><a name="lists"></a>Lists</h3>
<p>Lists, or Exchange Distribution Lists, are a great way to manage users in a select team or group. Only e-mail address in your domain can be part of a distribution List. For example, we have a billing team we would like to group together, (bob@domain.com, amy@domain.com, scott@domain.com). We will create a distribution list for the team so they can communicate new upcoming billing updates within the team, billingupdates@domain.com.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Setting up a List</strong></p>
<p>To setup a List, log into the Admin Control Panel <a title="here" href="https://cp.rackspace.com/Exchange/Mail/Lists/">here</a>.<a title="here" href="https://cp.rackspace.com/EmailHosting/Mail/GroupLists" target="_blank"><br /></a></p>

<h3><strong><a name="owa"></a>Outlook Web App (OWA)</strong></h3>
<p>The Outlook Web App is a direct connection to your E-mail without the need of additional software. Accessing your E-mail account from OWA is very beneficial, messages that are sent and received using OWA will be waiting for you the next time you log into the portal. The OWA portal provides most of the same funtionality a mail client would offer, from sending/receiving email to setting up email signatures to even setting rules to filter messages to sub-folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OWA Vs. Mail Client</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to configure additional server settings for OWA.</li>
<li>Email is ready to access 24/7 through the most popular web browsers (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari)</li>
<li>Messages are stored in the cloud so no local storage is consumed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Changes made to Contacts, Calendar and Mail items are synced down to all other devices configured with your account.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
