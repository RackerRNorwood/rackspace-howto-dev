<p>The following article below will get your Microsoft Exchange 2007 email account setup on your Android Device using the Activesync technology. Let's take a look at the following steps below to get you going:</p>

<p><em>Note: The following article is a general guide for setting up all Android devices. The steps may vary depending on the OS you're running.</em></p>

<p>1. After your administrator has purchased an&nbsp;<strong>Activesync</strong>&nbsp;license and assigned it to your email address, you'll want to log into your&nbsp;<strong>User Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;at the following URL:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp" target="_blank">https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp</a></strong></p>

<p>2. Once you're logged in, scroll down to the&nbsp;<strong>Client Setup</strong>&nbsp;section and click on the&nbsp;<strong>ActiveSync</strong>&nbsp;link. This will open the&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync</strong>&nbsp;window which will contain the information needed to set up your device.</p>

<p>3. Once you have your&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync&nbsp;</strong>window open,&nbsp;select the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;icon&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>Home</strong>&nbsp;screen on your device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Next, enter your email address and password under the <strong>Configure exchange account in a few steps field</strong>. Afterwards select the <strong>Manual setup</strong> option.</p>

<p><em>Note: Depending on what OS of Android you're running, if you have just the "Domain" as an option, you may leave this field blank</em>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Next, enter the Domain address exactly as it appears from the&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync&nbsp;</strong>window followed by a "\" (backslash) with the username&nbsp;exactly as it appears from the&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync&nbsp;</strong>window. Then enter in your password and the Exchange server&nbsp;exactly as it appears from the&nbsp;<strong>Setting Up ActiveSync&nbsp;</strong>window.</p>

<p>7. On the following screen, select <strong>OK</strong>. Next, select all that apply to you and on the last screen, give your account a name and you're finished. Mail will start populating in your inbox if everything was done correctly.</p>
