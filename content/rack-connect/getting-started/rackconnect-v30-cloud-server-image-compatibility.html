<p><strong>Applies to</strong>: RackConnect v3.0</p>

<p>RackConnect v3.0 has no restrictions on cloud server images. All of the cloud server images listed as available in your RackConnect v3.0-enabled cloud account are compatible with RackConnect v3.0. You can see the list of cloud server images available for your cloud account by using the <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/list_images.html" target="_blank">Cloud Servers API</a>, or when you build a new cloud server in the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a>.RackConnect v3.0 is also compatible with all next generation Cloud Servers flavors, including Standard and&nbsp;General Purpose flavors, as well as&nbsp;I/O, Compute, and Memory optimized flavors.</p>

<p>This enhanced cloud server image compatibility is possible because RackConnect v3.0 leverages the same underlying technology as Cloud Networks. As a result, RackConnect v3.0 can support all cloud servers that Cloud Networks supports. This also means that RackConnect v3.0 does not currently support OnMetal servers. You can view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-v30-compatibility-matrix" target="_blank">RackConnect v3.0 Compatibility Matrix</a> for a list of all products with which RackConnect v3.0 is compatible.</p>

<p>To provide you with the best experience possible, we recommend that you use the Cloud Control Panel, rather than the MyRackspace Portal, when building new RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers or when working and performing any tasks with your RackConnect v3.0 associated cloud account.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: When you build RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers, be sure to select the region where your RackConnect v3.0 environment is located. Cloud servers created in a different region are not usable with your RackConnect v3.0 configuration.</p>

<h3><strong>'Access IP' address</strong></h3>

<p>Each cloud server instance has an entry associated with it called an <em>access IP</em> that RackConnect v3.0 uses to store the dedicated public IP address of your cloud servers. You can see this value by accessing a cloud server's details via the Cloud Servers API or by viewing the <strong>RackConnect IP</strong> field of your cloud servers in the Cloud Control Panel.&nbsp; By default, with RackConnect v3.0, an access IP is not set when you build a cloud server via the Cloud Control Panel, unless you select the <strong>RackConnect IP</strong> option to provision a public IP address. The access IP is also updated when you add and remove a public IP address from your cloud servers with the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-v30-api" target="_blank">RackConnect v3.0 API</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Both access_ip_v4 and access_ip_v6 values are listed via the Cloud Servers API, but because RackConnect v3.0 is currently an IPv4-only solution, only the access_ip_v4 value is modified when you add and remove dedicated public IP addresses from your RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers.</p>
