<p>This article provides a high-level overview of the steps to perform to migrate your applications to Rackspace Cloud from Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">Based on your existing AWS instance size and configuration, select an equivalent size and scope for the Rackspace Cloud Servers instance to provision. Also, list the resources that you want to migrate, including application and database resources.</p><h3>Provision and configure the Cloud Servers instance</h3><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">Depending on the size of your existing AWS instance and OS, select an equivalent instance type and follow the steps to provision a new instance on Rackspace Cloud Servers. You can find a list of equivalent instances in the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/mapping-of-amazon-web-services-resources-to-rackspace-resources#instancetypes">equivalent instance types list.</a></p><h3>Install software packages</h3><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">Install the required applications on your newly provisioned Rackspace Cloud Servers instance.</p><h3><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Migrate data</span></h3><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">After you back up your data on your AWS instance, use one of the following methods to transfer your data from AWS to your cloud server. You can do this a number of ways:</p><ul style="line-height: 1.538em;" type="disc"><li><strong>(Preferred) Use OpenStack Swift, a command-line interface, to transfer your data from AWS to Cloud Files:</strong><p>This is the recommended method for migrating your data to your cloud server. Using this method, you install Swift on your AWS instance and directly copy your data from AWS to Cloud Files, without downloading it locally.</p></li><li><strong>rsync:</strong><p>You can use <a href="/knowledge_center/article/backing-up-your-files-with-rsync" target="_blank">rsync</a> to tunnel between your two instances and <a href="/knowledge_center/article/migrating-a-linux-server-from-the-command-line-stage-1" target="_blank">transfer your data</a>. The other methods listed here, however, have you create backups in Cloud Files so that you can always return to them.</p></li><li><strong>Install a GUI tool on your local computer:</strong><p>In certain cases (for example, if your cloud server is Windows based), you need to install a GUI tool (such as <a href="/knowledge_center/article/configuring-rackspace-cloud-files-with-cyberduck" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>) to upload the data on Cloud Files. Several open source and free tools exist, and they are described in detail within each migration scenario in this document.</p></li><li><strong>Use the Cloud Control Panel to upload files:</strong><p>The Cloud Control Panel enables you to upload data from your local computer to the server instance. This method is useful for situations in which you do not want to install additional software for data transfer. However, we do not recommend downloading your data locally because it is not the most secure option.</p></li></ul><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">After your data is uploaded to Cloud Files, download and restore the data on your cloud server.</p><h3>Configure</h3><p style="line-height: 1.538em;">Make any necessary configuration changes for your application and database.</p><h3><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Test after migration</span></h3><ul style="line-height: 1.538em;"><li>Implement monitoring and backup solutions, and focus on enhancing security.</li><li>Thoroughly test the applications deployed on your cloud server.</li></ul><p>With the that overview in mind, the first step to migrating your application the the Rackspace Cloud is <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/provisioning-cloud-resources-to-migrate-from-amazon-web-services">provisioning your cloud services</a>.</p>
