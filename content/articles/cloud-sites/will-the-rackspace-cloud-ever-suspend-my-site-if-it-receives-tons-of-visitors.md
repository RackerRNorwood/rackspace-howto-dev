We here at The Rackspace Cloud will never suspend a site as long as the
traffic is legitimate and the hosted content doesn't violate our TOS or
our AUP. As a company, we succeed when you succeed so we will always
encourage legitimate traffic to your sites. We have several domains on
Cloud Sites that receive millions of hits each month. We have never
limited or throttled their accounts, that's part of the benefit of going
with an offering like The Rackspace Cloud. On the other side of the
coin, we will stop any illegitimate spikes in traffic. For instance,
runaway scripts or DDOS attacks, etc.
