You can reach this interface at one of the following URLs, depending on the datacenter housing your database:</p><ul><li>DFW 1-1:&nbsp;<a title="https://mysql.dfw1-1.websitesettings.com" href="https://mysql.dfw1-1.websitesettings.com/" rel="nofollow">https://mysql.dfw1-1.websitesettings.com</a></li><li>DFW 1-2:&nbsp;<a title="https://mysql.dfw1-2.websitesettings.com" href="https://mysql.dfw1-2.websitesettings.com/" rel="nofollow">https://mysql.dfw1-2.websitesettings.com</a></li><li>ORD 1-1:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysql.ord1-1.websitesettings.com/">https://mysql.ord1-1.websitesettings.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>Which datacenter is my database located in?</strong></p><p>To find out if your account is located in our ORD or DFW datacenter, check the test link for your site. If your testlink includes <strong>dfw</strong> in the URL, such as www.domain.com.php5-2.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com then your account is in DFW.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Alternatively, you can download use other programs such as&nbsp;<a title="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL Gui Tools (Free: Windows, Mac, Linux)</a>,&nbsp;<a title="http://www.webyog.com/" href="http://www.webyog.com/" rel="nofollow">SQLyog</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="http://www.navicat.com" href="http://www.navicat.com/" rel="nofollow">Navicat</a>, from their respective providers, to manage your MySQL databases as well.</em></p><p><strong>How do I login to PHPmyAdmin?</strong></p></div></div><ul><li>First, log into the <a href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Rackspace Cloud Control Panel</a></li><li>Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Hosting-</strong><strong>&gt;Cloud Sites</strong>.</li></ul><p><img src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/cloudsites.png" alt="" border="1" /></p><ul><li>Click the <strong>domain name</strong> that the database exists under</li></ul><ul><li>Click the <strong>Features</strong> tab</li></ul><p><img src="http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/featurestab.png" alt="" width="598" border="1" /></p><ul><li>Confirm that the database is active by scrolling to the <strong>Databases</strong> section.

The number that prefixes the user name is the account number for the website owner (yourself or your client) and is important when logging in, so be sure to enter the user name exactly as it is listed on this page.</em></p><ul><li>The password is the password associated with the database user, which would have been chosen when you created the database and database user. Because this user is separate from your Control Panel account and FTP users, the password may or may not be the same as those users. If you cannot remember your database password, you can reset the password by clicking the user in the list and filling out the password form; however, <strong>be aware that your website code may rely on the existing password, so changing the password for a database user could cause database connection errors on your website!</strong> If you are working with a live website and cannot risk this password reset, contact a <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/Working_with_a_MSSQL_database">web developer</a> for assistance.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>With the information described above,</strong> you're ready to start working with the database.
