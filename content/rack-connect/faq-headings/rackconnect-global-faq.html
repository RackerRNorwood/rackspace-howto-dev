<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-WhatisRackConnectGlobal?">What is RackConnect Global ?</h3>

<p>RackConnect Global (RCGlobal) is a connectivity service that makes it possible for you to deploy a hybrid cloud infrastructure at Rackspace with the best&nbsp;network performance possible.&nbsp;Please see <a class="external-link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/global" rel="nofollow">http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/global</a>&nbsp;for more details.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-Whoisittargetedforandwhatpainpointsdoesitsolve?">Who is RCGlobal&nbsp;targeted for and what pain points does it solve?</h3>

<p>RCGlobal&nbsp;is targeted&nbsp;towards enterprise users that want to connect their infrastructure at Rackspace with their infrastructure outside of Rackspace&nbsp;without going over the internet. Traditionally you would choose a site-to-site VPN solution or work with a network provider to drop a leased line into Rackspace Data Centers. While the first solution results in unpredictable latency and throughput, the latter involves working with a third party provider, which can prove costly. RCGlobal&nbsp;allows you to deploy your hybrid cloud in a network&nbsp;with&nbsp;low latency,&nbsp;predictable throughput, and predictable redundancy at a reasonable cost to you, all managed by Rackspace Fanatical Support.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-Whataretheprimaryusecases?">What are the primary use cases ?</h3>

<p>If you want to use Rackspace infrastructure for Backup/Disaster recovery scenarios (for example, database replication),&nbsp;if you&nbsp;are seeking to avoid the internet networking path to reduce the&nbsp;latency and if you want to make throughput predictable,&nbsp;RCGlobal&nbsp;helps you achieve this goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RCGlobal also works for those who want to deploy some components of your infrastructure at Rackspace (for example a database in Rackspace) whereas you may want to deploy&nbsp;other components (web/front-end) in other clouds (like Azure). RCG&nbsp;makes the connectivity between components faster and more reliable than connectivity&nbsp;over the internet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lastly, RCGlobal will work for those who have&nbsp;latency sensitive services (like VoIP/Video) on Rackspace and may want dedicated access to Rackspace for good performence.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-IsthisproductbeinglaunchedforDedicatedhostingorcloudcustomers?Whatnetworkscanbeconnected?">Is this product being launched for Dedicated hosting or cloud customers ? What networks can be connected ?</h3>

<div>RCG&nbsp;is being targeted primary for Rackspace dedicated hosting users at launch. Dedicated hosting users who want to establish a virtual circuit to connect the dedicated private (ExNet) address space at Rackspace to a private address space on their side of the connection (for purposes like Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity for eg. database replication) are&nbsp;the target customer set. However, Rackspace Cloud or Dedicated hosting customers who want to access Public prefixes via RCG&nbsp;may also do so via dedicated cross-connect only. Note that customers cannot use RCGlobal to connect to private prefixes on the Rackspace Public cloud&nbsp;(for example,&nbsp;Cloud networks).</div>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-Inwhatregionsistheservicebeinglaunched?">In what regions is the service being launched ?</h3>

<p>RCGlobal will be available in all three US Datacenters&nbsp;at this time (ORD, IAD and DFW). The service will be avaliable in LON at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-WhataretheconnectivityoptionsforcustomersestablishaconnectionviaRCGlobal?">What are the connectivity options for users to establish a connection via RCGlobal ?</h3>

<p>Users can connect via three means:</p>

<p>(a) Dedicated cross-connect if they are colocated at the Equinix facilities in the US , i,e, DFW, ORD, IAD</p>

<p>(b) They can be a buyer on the Equinix cloud exchange</p>

<p>(c) They can be a Microsoft Azure customer using ExpressRoute (this is a Microsoft Equivalent of RCGlobal)</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-CanweconnecttoPubliccloudIsolatednetworks(Cloudnetworks)overRackConnectv3?">Can we connect to Public cloud isolated networks (Cloud networks) over RackConnect v3 ?</h3>

<p>No, we do not support any sort of connectivity to any Public Cloud resources via RackConnect v2 or v3 at this time.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-Whatspeedsaresupported?">What speeds are supported ?</h3>

<p>We support connectivity speeds of 100Mbps, 200Mbps, 500 Mbps and 1Gbps at launch. Higher speeds will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Note that these are the speeds supported by Rackspace and can only be supported if the other end of the virtual circuit is capable of supporting these speeds.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-IsaDedicatedAggregationdeviceneededtousethisservice?">Is a Dedicated Aggregation device needed to use this service ?</h3>

<p>Yes, a Dedicated Aggregation device (CE) is needed at this time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-WhatkindofDedicatedAggr.(CE)devicesaresupported?">What kind of Dedicated Aggregation&nbsp;(CE) devices are supported ?</h3>

<p>At this time we recommend one of these devices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arista 7050-SX</li>
	<li>CIsco 9372-PX&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-AreDedicatedTORsneededtousethisservice?">Are Dedicated TORs needed to use this service ?</h3>

<div>Yes we need dedicated TORs. We cannot connect shared TORs to Dedicated aggregation devices&nbsp;as that would create a problem with zone management, billing, automation, monitoring and complicates troubleshooting. &nbsp;Cisco 2960 devices can be used as TORs.</div>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-Isthetrafficsecure?">Is the traffic secure ?</h3>

<p>The service does not provide encryption of any sort. It is purely an MPLS VPN connection. The traffic rides all the way through the&nbsp;Rackspace Backbone (the network that interconnects Rackspace regions and provides connectivity outside of Rackspace)&nbsp;without hitting the internet path and is inherently secure.</p>

<h3 id="RackConnectGlobal-DoestheservicehaveanSLA?">Does the service have an SLA ?</h3>

<p class="p1">Rackspace provides a 99.9% uptime SLA (this is defined as follows : "Rackspace guarantees that the termination end point for the RackConnect Global Service virtual circuit will be able to accept connections 99.9% of the time in any calendar month, provided that there are two or more virtual circuit termination end points at the Rackspace data center location.").&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="p1" id="RackConnectGlobal-WhatisthehighlevelprocedurebywhichanRCGlobalconnectioncanbeorderedandprovisionedforthecustomer?">What is the high level procedure by which an RCGlobal connection can be ordered and provisioned for the customer ?</h3>

<p>The complete procedure can be found at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-global-user-workflow</p>
