[Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint:
Overview](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-overview)

Rackspace Storage App supports the dragging of files into containers.
After you have navigated to a container inside the app, the page
displays a *drop zone* into which you can drag files (as shown in the
following figure). Any files that you drop into the drop zone are
streamed to your Cloud Files account.

How to delete a file within a container
---------------------------------------

Within the Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint, you can delete a
file from a container in the following ways:

-   Delete a single file by clicking the delete icon to the right of the
    file's name.
-   Delete multiple files at one time by selecting the cloud icon to the
    left of each file's name and then clicking Delete Selected. Rows
    that you select for deletion are highlighted with a dark gray
    background.

When you delete a file, it is permanently removed from the Cloud Files
container.

Where to go from here
---------------------

Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint enables you to generate
temporary URLs for files and share the files with other people. Learn
how to do this at [How to Share a File with Another
Person](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-how-to-share-a-file-with-another-person).
