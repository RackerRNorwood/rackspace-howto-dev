<p>Change is a regular part of business. This guide describes the various administrative account changes that we can assist you with. Review the different types of change requests and the appropriate steps needed to complete them.</p>

	<li><a href="#changed_name">Company changed name</a></li>
	<li><a href="#changed_contact">Primary contact listed on the account is no longer with the company or no longer managing the account</a></li>

<h2><strong><a id="new_owner" name="new_owner"></a>Company under new ownership or tax ID changed</strong></h2>

<p>If the ownership of your company has changed or the company's tax ID has changed, you must inform us of these changes by completing&nbsp;the <strong>Assignment and Assumption form</strong>. This form requires signatures from both the assignor (original account owner) and the assignee (new account owner).</p>

<p>You can download the <strong>Assignment and Assumption</strong> form directly from the Cloud Control Panel by using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the <strong>Account</strong> menu, select <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Account Details</strong> section, click the <strong>Documents and&nbsp;Forms</strong> link.</li>
	<li>Complete the&nbsp;<strong>Assignment and Assumption</strong>&nbsp;form.</li>
	<li>Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are a Dedicated Hosting customer, you can request this form directly from your Account Manager.</p>

<h2><strong><a id="changed_name" name="changed_name"></a>Company&nbsp;name&nbsp;changed</strong></h2>

<p>If your company has filed for a name change with the Secretary of State where the company is registered and there was a change in tax ID, complete&nbsp;the <strong>Assignment and Assumption</strong> form.</p>

<p>See the preceeding section for information about obtaining and submitting this form.</p>

<p>If the company name has changed&nbsp;but there was no change in tax ID or ownership, you must complete one of the following forms to provide evidence of the name change:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Certificate of Name Change</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Certificate of Amendment</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Attach these forms&nbsp;to a support ticket&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Company Name Change Request </strong>in&nbsp;the subject line.</p>

<h2><strong><a id="changed_contact" name="changed_contact"></a>Primary contact listed on the account is no longer with the company or no longer managing the account</strong></h2>

<p>If you have access to the account, you can update the primary contact details in the <strong>Account Settings</strong> section in the <a href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not the primary contact, you must fill out the <strong>Primary Contact Change</strong> form and submit it via a support ticket.</p>

<p>You can download this form directly from the Cloud Control Panel by using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong>&nbsp;menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Account Details</strong>&nbsp;section, click the <strong>Documents and&nbsp;Forms</strong>&nbsp;link.</li>
	<li>Complete the <strong>Primary Contact Change</strong> form.</li>
	<li>Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;The primary contact email address is used for all account notifications and for regaining the credentials for access to an account when&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><strong>I forgot my password</strong><span>&nbsp;link is used.</span></p>

<p>To update the billing information, including the billing address and the credit card on file, go to the <strong>Billing &amp; Payments</strong> section.</p>

<h2><strong><a id="best_practices" name="best_practices"></a>Best practices for legal change forms</strong></h2>

<p>The forms described in this guide have many required fields that must be completed before the Billing team can process the forms. After you have completed a form, scan the document and attach it to the support ticket within the <a href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>. Allow two business days for the Billing team to review.</p>

<p>To avoid form rejection, use the following tips when completing the form:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The signatures on the <strong>Assignment and Assumption</strong> form&nbsp;<em>must</em> come from an officer or an owner of the company.</li>
	<li>The owner or officer must initial any changes regarding an increase in MMR or added devices or domains that are made to the form after the initial submission.</li>
	<li>No blank fields are allowed on any form, except where indicated. You may not type <strong>Same</strong>&nbsp;in any field</li>
</ul>
