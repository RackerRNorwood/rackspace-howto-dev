Streaming allows users to serve their content directly from Akamai edge
servers, rather than downloading full files before they are veiwable. 
Using the OSMF plugins let developers make their own Adobe Flash
players, giving them the flexibility to customize and brand them as they
wish. 

Download the [Advanced Streaming Plugin for
OSMF](http://mediapm.edgesuite.net/akamai-osmf-plugins/samples/).

Since OSMF plugins allow you to develop your own Flash video player and
embed it as needed into your website, Rackspace does not have
step-by-step instructions.  If you are looking for a player that does
not require development by your team, try our [FlowPlayer plugins for
Streaming over the Akamai
CDN](/knowledge_center/article/cloud-files-streaming-with-flowplayer-plugins).
