<p>If your website is running in <a class="external text" href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=060103" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=060103">integrated mode</a>, you might have noticed that your <a class="external text" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa903367(VS.71).aspx" rel="nofollow" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa903367(VS.71).aspx">HttpHandlers</a> no longer function even though they are set in your <strong>web.config</strong> file.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>This behavior is expected because integrated mode changed the way that modules and handlers are defined in the <strong>web.config</strong> file, compared to classic mode in IIS 7 or IIS 6. Integrated mode is the default for IIS 7 and currently the default for all new IIS/ASP.NET websites created in the Rackspace Cloud. If your website code was originally written for classic mode or using IIS 6, the <strong>web.config</strong> file might need to be updated.</p>
