<p>When content is being served from your Cloud Sites websites, you might occasionally receive the <code>Connection timed out - please try again</code> error message.&nbsp;This article explains the causes of the error,&nbsp;provides steps that you&nbsp;can take to improve the&nbsp;experience, and tells you about the steps we have taken to mitigate the problem.<br />

<h3>What doe the error message mean?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The <code>Connection timed out â€“ please try again</code> error message is displayed when a script exceeds the maximum timeout value of 30 seconds.&nbsp;If the load balancer that is serving the content does not receive data from the server processing the data, the load balancer closes the connection and the client immediately receives the error message.&nbsp;In most cases, the script continues to execute until it reaches completion, generates an error, or times out on the server; however, the page does not load on the client as expected, and client instead receives the connection timeout error.</p>

<h3>Why the error happens</h3>

<p>The connection timeout can be a difficult issue to troubleshoot, especially across all customer use cases. If you are seeing timeouts intermittently, we recommend that you audit your code; intermittent timeouts often indicate code that might need to be optimized or broken down into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>Following are some specific causes and suggestions for troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Database queries can be a culprit. A large or poorly optimized database can cause otherwise small queries to take a long time to return data. This issue can usually be alleviated by optimizing the database to reduce overhead from MyISAM or reorganize information in InnoDB. We recommend using InnoDB as the table storage engine because the Cloud Sites database servers are tuned for using it, among other advantages inherent&nbsp;to the format. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/mysql-engines-myisam-vs-innodb">http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/mysql-engines-myisam-vs-innodb</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For a longer running script in PHP, you can use the <code>exec</code> function to run the script in the background and write its status to a database or a file.&nbsp;You could then use AJAX to display a loading bar and check the script's status. After the script is completed, you can then remove the loading bar and proceed to a completion page. (This is just an example, but the concept is good for any situation.) Another option is to run the script as a cron job using PHP or Perl instead of HTTP, which is not subject to&nbsp;the load balancer's timeout and can run up to 15 minutes. For information about setting up a cron job, see <a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-schedule-a-cron-job-for-cloud-sites">http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-schedule-a-cron-job-for-cloud-sites</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This error can also occur when a site is trying to load files that don't exist (404 errors).&nbsp;This dramatically slows a site down and in rare cases can cause a timeout.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A site that is loading data from an external location can&nbsp;experience load issues that cause a timeout.&nbsp;For example, if a site relies on Google Analytics, Authorize.net, or PayPal, and the&nbsp;corresponding service&nbsp;goes down or begins responding slowly, the site experiences a performance issue that, in some cases, can cause the page not to load or to load intermittently.&nbsp;This issue could be caused by many different plug-ins for popular content management systems such as WordPress and&nbsp;Drupal or by simple calls in hand-coded sites.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In extremely rare cases, you might see this error message because an invalid cookie is being stored by your browser. Invalid cookies can cause you to see the error message on pages that initiate a session on your site (such as login or member pages, or sometimes even your homepage).&nbsp;Although rare, you should clear your browser cache and try the page again to verify that this is not the case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The bottom line</h3>

<p>In extremely rare cases, you might see this error message because an invalid cookie is being stored by your browser. Invalid cookies can cause you to see the error message on pages that initiate a session on your site (such as login or member pages, or sometimes even your homepage).&nbsp;Although rare, you should clear your browser cache and try the page again to verify that this is not the case.</p>
