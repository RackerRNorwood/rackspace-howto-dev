<h2>Hadoop</h2>

<p>Hadoop is an open source project that provides a platform to store and process massive amounts of data. Hadoop uses the Map Reduce paradigm to split large tasks into many smaller chunks and executes them in parallel. Each of these tasks are executed close to the data in the Hadoop Distributed File System.</p>

<h3>Hadoop Use Cases</h3>

<p>In a very short time, Hadoop has revolutionized almost every business sector. Actual use cases involving Hadoop include:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Analyzing medical data.</li>
	<li>Analyzing transaction data to detect anomalies and suggest fraudulent behavior.</li>
	<li>Processing high definition images from satellites and detecting patterns of geographical change.</li>
	<li>Processing machine-generated data to identify malware and cyber attack patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>This document is for educational purposes only and will provide you with an example of how to get started with Apache Hadoop in the Cloud. You will learn how to launch a Hadoop cluster starting with 2 nodes and growing it up to 64 nodes. During this process you will learn how to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create cloud servers through Cloud Control Panel.</li>
	<li>Create cloud servers using scripts.</li>
	<li>Install and configure Hadoop.</li>
	<li>Run Map Reduce applications.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The following prerequisites are expected for successful completion:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Rackspace Cloud account (<a href="https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/">https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/</a>).</li>
	<li>SSH client (Windows users can download PUTTY: <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a>).</li>
	<li>Basic knowledge of Linux.</li>
	<li>Basic knowledge of Hadoop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hadoop Installation Process</h2>

<p>Manually installing and configuring Hadoop can be somewhat complicated so we will use a few tools to make the installation easier. In particular, we are going to use the following two projects:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Chef recipes for Hadoop (<a href="https://github.rackspace.com/CloudBigData/cookbook-hadoop-conf" title="https://github.rackspace.com/CloudBigData/cookbook-hadoop-conf">https://github.rackspace.com/CloudBigData/cookbook-hadoop-conf</a>)</li>
	<li>Knife plugin for Rackspace API (<a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the tools, we will create a Hadoop installation using the following:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>1 cloud server as workstation</li>
	<li>1 cloud server as Hadoop Master node.</li>
	<li>1 cloud server as Hadoop Worker node.</li>
	<li>Gradually add up to 63 more Hadoop Worker nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, we will break up each part of the build into separate sections and tasks that follow.</p>

<h3>Set Up the Server as Workstation</h3>

<p>In this section, we will build the workstation to be our launching ground to build the remainder of our Hadoop environment.</p>

<h4>Create a Cloud Server</h4>

<p>Login to <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">https://mycloud.rackspace.com</a> and create a cloud server using a Linux image. &nbsp;Record the IP address and password for the server.</p>

<p>Wait for your server to be in an Available state. We will be using this server going forward to create other servers. To begin, SSH into it and run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
<code>export RACKSPACE_API_USERNAME=&lt;Your Rackspace Cloud account username&gt;
export RACKSPACE_API_KEY=&lt;Your API Key&gt;
export RACKSPACE_VERSION=v2
export RACKSPACE_ENDPOINT=https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2
curl -L https://raw.github.com/sacharya/random-scripts/master/knife-rackspace-hadoop/chef-knife-install.sh | bash</code></pre>

<p>Note: for information about how to find your API key, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/view-and-reset-your-api-key">View and reset your API key</a>.</p>

<p>This will install the Chef server, knife-rackspace plugin and upload the chef hdp-cookbooks, and configure it to talk to Rackspace Cloud using your account. We can now use the knife client to interact with Rackspace Cloud and configure our Hadoop cluster.</p>

<h4>Choosing the Image</h4>

<p>You need a CentOS 6.2 image as the base image for the server to install Hadoop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>IMAGE_ID=`knife rackspace image list | grep 'CentOS 6.2' | awk '{print $1}'`
echo $IMAGE_ID</code></pre>

<h4>Choosing the Flavor</h4>

<p>We will use a flavor with 4096 MB of RAM for the server.&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>FLAVOR_ID=`knife rackspace flavor list | grep '4096' | awk '{print $1}'`
echo $FLAVOR_ID</code></pre>

<h4>Creating your Environment</h4>

<p>In order not to conflict with other Hadoop clusters within the same account, we will create a Chef environment called yourname to create our Hadoop cluster on. We will save this name in an environment variable so we can reference it later.</p>

<pre>
<code>ENV_NAME=&lt;Your Name&gt;
echo $ENV_NAME</code></pre>

<p>Now run the following commands to setup the environment within Chef.</p>

<pre>
<code>cp /root/hdp-cookbooks/environments/example.json /root/hdp-cookbooks/environments/$ENV_NAME.json
sed -i "s/example/$ENV_NAME/g" /root/hdp-cookbooks/environments/$ENV_NAME.json
knife environment from file /root/hdp-cookbooks/environments/$ENV_NAME.json</code></pre>

<h4>Creating a Hadoop Master</h4>

<p>This command will create a cloud server with the name, yourname-hadoopmaster with CentOS 6.2 and 4 GB RAM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will create it in the example environment and give it a role of hadoop-master. Chef will then install and configure all the components required to make it a Hadoop Master node.</p>

<pre>
<code>knife rackspace server create --server-name $ENV_NAME-hadoopmaster --image $IMAGE_ID --flavor $FLAVOR_ID --environment $ENV_NAME --run-list 'role[hadoop-master]'</code></pre>

<p>Now, copy the hadoopmaster’s public IP and password from the output. We will save the IP address in an environment variable to use later.</p>

<pre>
<code>HADOOP_M_IP=&lt;Hadoop Master IP&gt;
echo $HADOOP_M_IP</code></pre>

<p>Run the following commands:</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Ideally, you shouldn’t have to run the code below, but there is currently a bug in the hdp-cookbooks where the hostname is not propagated properly. So you have to run this extra step.</p>

<pre>
<code>ssh root@$HADOOP_M_IP "chef-client &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/hadoop-namenode restart &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/hadoop-jobtracker restart"</code></pre>

<p>Verify that the master is up by going to the jobtracker at:</p>

<pre>
http://&lt;Hadoop Master IP&gt;:50030</pre>

<h4>Creating a Hadoop Worker</h4>

<p>From your server workstation, execute the following command to create a Hadoop worker node:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>knife rackspace server create --server-name $ENV_NAME-hadoopworker1 --image $IMAGE_ID --flavor $FLAVOR_ID --environment $ENV_NAME --run-list 'role[hadoop-worker]'</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, copy the hadoopworker1’s public IP and password at the end. We will save the hadoop worker IP address in an environment variable to use later.</p>

<pre>
<code>HADOOP_W1_IP=&lt;Hadoop Worker 1 IP Address&gt;
echo $HADOOP_W1_IP</code></pre>

<p>Run the following command:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>ssh root@$HADOOP_W1_IP "chef-client &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/hadoop-datanode restart &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/hadoop-tasktracker restart"</code></pre>

<p>Verify that the worker is running by going to the jobtracker at:</p>

<pre>
http://&lt;Hadoop Master IP&gt;:50030</pre>

<h4>Running a Map Reduce Application</h4>

<p>Now, SSH to the HadoopMaster node you created above and run the following examples:</p>

<pre>
<code>ssh root@$HADOOP_M_IP
hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-examples-1.0.3.15.jar pi 10 1000000</code></pre>

<p>This task runs a simulation to estimate the value of pi based on sampling.</p>

<pre>
<code>curl -L "https://raw.github.com/sacharya/random-scripts/master/knife-rackspace-hadoop/wordcount.sh" | bash</code></pre>

<p>This script will download all of Shakespeare’s books from project, Gutenberg, upload them to HDFS and run a Map Reduce operation run a word count against the text.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Adding More Nodes</h4>

<p>So far, you have created only <strong>hadoopworker1</strong>. Keep adding more HadoopWorker nodes following the same process. Make sure to increment the hadoopworker number each time. Run and benchmark your application and see how it performs when the size of the cluster grows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you feel comfortable, you can also play with different flavor sizes and see what works best for your application.</p>

<h4>Deleting the Cluster</h4>

<p>If you are done with your computation, you may want to delete the cluster and free up the resources. To do this, you need the server id of the server you want to delete. &nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>knife rackspace server list
knife rackspace server delete `knife rackspace server list | grep $HADOOP_M_IP | awk '{print $1}'`
knife rackspace server delete `knife rackspace server list | grep $HADOOP_W1_IP | awk '{print $1}'`</code></pre>

<p>Repeat the process for all the servers in the cluster by replacing $HADOOP_W1_IP with the IP for the appropriate worker number.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
