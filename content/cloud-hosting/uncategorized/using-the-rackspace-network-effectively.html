<h2>What is the Rackspace Network?</h2>

<p>The Rackspace Network is the internal network in each Rackspace region (data center). In the Cloud Sites Cloud Control Panel, the Rackspace Network was called ServiceNet. In the Cloud Control Panel, it's referred to as the Rackspace Network.</p>

<h2>Using the Rackspace Network Internal IP Address</h2>

<p>When you create a new Cloud Server, Cloud Load Balancer, or Cloud Database, the newly created infrastructure is automatically assigned a Rackspace Network IP address. This IP address is not visible on the public internet. However, if you have other assets (Cloud Servers, Cloud Load Balancers, and Cloud Databases) located in the same region, you can use the internal IP address to connect the infrastructure together. For example, you can create a Cloud Load Balancer for two or more Cloud Servers in the same region using the Rackspace Network internal IP addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Any traffic or communication between cloud infrastructure in the same region is free of charge. If traffic goes from one region to another (Dallas-Fort Worth to Chicago, for example) it accrues normal bandwidth charges.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using the internal Rackspace Network is that it can offer the first level of network security. For example if you're not expecting external traffic to your Cloud Servers, you can create a firewall around them and reduce their exposure to outside threats. Note that Rackspace creates all new servers with basic security settings, however you should follow the instructions located in <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/node/2327">Configuring Basic Security </a>to further protect your data.</p>

<h2>Finding the Rackspace IP Address</h2>

<p>You can find all of the IP addresses for a new server, load balancer or database by clicking on it and viewing its Details.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a Server Details page:</p>
