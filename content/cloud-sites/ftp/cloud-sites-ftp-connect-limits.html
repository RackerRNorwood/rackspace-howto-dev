<p>In order to protect the performance of the Rackspace Cloud Sites shared platform and to serve a large user base, the maximum number of client connections allowed for a single FTP user is ten (10).</p><p>You might have run afoul of this limit if you've seen an error message like:</p><pre>530 Sorry, the maximum number of clients (10) for this user are already connected.</pre><p>There are a few steps you can take to make sure you stay within the connection limit:</p><ul><li>If you are using Filezilla or a similar FTP program, lower the "Maximum simultaneous transfers" below 10.</li><li>Restrict the number of users who have access to your FTP username and password.</li><li>Coordinate with other people using your FTP username so they're aware of the connection cap and account for it in their FTP client settings.</li></ul>
