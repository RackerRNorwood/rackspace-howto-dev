When you transfer your .uk domain into a new registrar, you must ensure
that the Internet Provider Security (IPS) tag points to the correct
place before you begin the transfer process. If you are transferring
your domain registration to Rackspace, the IPS tag must point to
TUCOWS-CA.\
 \
To change the IPS tag, contact your current Domain Registrar and request
the change (some providers might  charge an administration fee).
