<p>Because domain transfer processes can vary, the process outlined in this document is meant to serve as a general guideline. It applies only to customers who have either <em>registered </em>or <em>transferred </em>their domains through the Cloud Sites Control Panel.</p>

<h2>Terms and definitions</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Losing registrar</strong>: The registrar from which the domain is being transferred. In this case, Click and Name (Cloud Sites Registrar) is the losing registrar.</li>
	<br />
	<li><strong>Winning registrar</strong>: The registrar that is requesting the domain transfer (for example, Name.com, Network Solutions, or GoDaddy).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initiate a transfer request</h2>

<p>Sign up with the domain registrar of your choice (for example, Name.com, Network Solutions, or GoDaddy) and initiate a <em>domain transfer request</em>, following the registrar's instructions.</p>

<h2>Obtain an authorization code from Click and Name</h2>

<p>To transfer the domain, the winning registrar will likely require you to provide them with the domain authorization code (also called the EPP code). To obtain the code, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left navigation pane, click <strong>Hosting &gt; Cloud Sites</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click the domain for which you want to obtain the authorization code.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>DNS </strong>tab.</li>
	<li>Under <strong>Domain Registration</strong>, click <strong>Retrieve Domain Authcode</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the domain is either an alias or has been removed from the control panel, contact Rackspace Support. Support can send an automated email with the authorization code, if the email address in the WHOIS record is valid. For information about reviewing your WHOIS information, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/608">Perform a WHOIS search</a>.</p>

<h2>Provide the authorization code to the winning registrar</h2>

<p>After you obtain the authorization code, you provide it to the winning registrar. Depending on the registrar, you might receive an email with instructions, or you might be able to enter the code into their portal.</p>

<p>After you complete these steps, the process should be automated; no further action should be required of you. Although Support cannot process the domain transfer for you, contact us for any questions you have about the process.</p>
