Entourage 2008 users who prefer the EWS version (Exchange Web Services
Edition) will be glad to know Rackspace has the setup guide for you to
get you up and running. Let's take a look at the following steps below
to get you going:

 

***Note**: If you're unsure about what type of version of Entourage you
have, go to **Entourage** located at the top and select **About
Entourage** and it should state "**Web Services Edition**."*

 

1.  First thing you'll want to do is log into your User Control Panel
    ([cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp)) and
    select the Enourage 2008 icon/link. This link will provide a pop up
    window with information needed to setup your account.

2.  Next, you'll open up Entourage and at the very top select Tools and
    then Accounts. You'll then select New and then Exchange. If the
    setup assistant window appears select Configure Account Manually and
    select New and then Exchnage.
