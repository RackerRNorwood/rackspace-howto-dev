If creating a website for your business is on the horizon, you may be
wondering which content management system (CMS) is the best choice for
you. Here&rsquo;s a look at three of the most widely-used ones. All three are
open-source software, each developed and maintained by a community of
thousands. Not only are all three free to download and use, but the
open-source format means that the platform is continuously being
improved to support new Internet technologies. With all of these
systems, basic functions can be enhanced ad infinitum with an
ever-expanding array of add-ons, contributed from their respective
communities.

There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution here; it depends on your goals,
technical expertise, budget and what you need your site to do. For a
simple blog or brochure-type site,
[Wordpress](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/web-hosting/wordpress/)
could be the best choice (while very friendly for non-developers, it&rsquo;s a
flexible platform also capable of very complex sites). For a complex,
highly customized site requiring scalability and complex content
organization,
[Drupal](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/web-hosting/drupal/) might
be the best choice. For something in between that has an easier learning
curve,
[Joomla](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/web-hosting/joomla/) may
be the answer.

When you have questions or need help, will you be able to find it
easily? With all of these systems, the answer is yes. Each has
passionate, dedicated developer and user communities, making it easy to
find free support directly through their websites or through other
online forums or even books. In addition, paid support is readily
available from third-party sources, such as consultants, developers and
designers. Each of these systems shows long-term sustainability and
longevity; support for them will continue to be readily available for
the foreseeable future. The more time and effort you are willing and
able to invest into learning a system, the more it will be able to do
for you. With both Wordpress and Joomla, you can order a wide range of
services and options off the menu to suit your needs; with Drupal,
you&rsquo;ll be in the kitchen cooking up what you want for yourself, with all
of the privileges of customization that entails.

See the comparison chart below for more insight into the differences in
these top content management systems. Still not sure? Download each of
the free platforms and do a trial run to help you decide.
