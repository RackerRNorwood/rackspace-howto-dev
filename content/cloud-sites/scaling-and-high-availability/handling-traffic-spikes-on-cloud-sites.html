<p>Our environment is designed to scale from small to large volumes of traffic, but since you know your business best we ask that you update us on extra-large volume, high traffic events (HTE). For an idea of what to expect you can compare your anticipated activity with these&nbsp;<a title="high traffic events" href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/tag/high-traffic-events-hte/" target="_blank">high traffic event incidents</a>.</p><p><img title="" src="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/traffic-spike.png" alt="" width="627" height="222" /></p><p>If you are expecting an abnormally high increase in traffic to your website (ie. hundreds of thousands of visitors in a few hours)&nbsp;we recommend reaching out to Support so we can monitor the event. Please call or chat with us and we can create a ticket for you.</p><p>You may also submit a ticket with the subject line: â€œExpected High Traffic Event for 'website name' on 'date'". We ask that you submit your ticket at least 7 days before the expected high traffic date.</p><p>In the ticket please provide us with information on the expected volume of traffic and the date you&nbsp;expect&nbsp;the traffic to begin to increase, along with some other applicable information:</p><ul><li>Whether the site is provisioned as an SSL site</li><li>Target URL(s)</li><li>Source IP address(es) (if known)</li><li>Date/time(s) of event (with time zone)</li><li>Duration of event</li><li>Expected traffic volume (in requests per second, estimate)</li><li>Type of application (proprietary, commercial, open source, etc.)</li><li>CMS, if applicable (Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.)</li><li>Any third-party calls from your app/site to domains outside of Cloud Sites (RSS feeds, APIs, curl, etc.)</li><li>Whether the app/site caches to a file system or database</li><li>Emergency contact info including cell phone number</li></ul><p>If applicable, please plan to disable comments/chat and traceback functionality during your event to reduce load.</p><p><em>Lastly, we recommend reviewing best practices for optimizing your web site on Rackspace Cloud Sites.&nbsp;<a title="Check out this Knowledge Center article" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-optimize-my-website-on-cloud-sites" target="_blank">Check this Knowledge Center article</a>&nbsp;for more information and details.</em></p>
