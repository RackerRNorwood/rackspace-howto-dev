<p><strong>Applies to</strong>: RackConnect v3.0</p>

<p>RackConnect v3.0 includes an enhanced API that lets you accomplish the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Seamlessly add and remove Cloud Servers from your load balancer pools</li>
	<li>List your available load balancer pools</li>
	<li>Add and remove public IP addresses from your Cloud Servers</li>
	<li>List your public IP addresses</li>
	<li>List the cloud networks associated with your RackConnect configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>RackConnect is based on and requires Rackspace Cloud Networks for cloud-side connectivity. Because of this, RackConnect is compatible only with the same types of Cloud Servers that Cloud Networks supports, which excludes first-generation Cloud Servers.</p>

<p>RackConnect has configuration options that can greatly improve security for your Cloud Servers environment, including support for servers built with only a single network interface connected to an isolated cloud network. You can choose to create a truly isolated and secure Cloud Servers environment that has connectivity only with other servers on the same isolated network, or you can allow network access to your dedicated networks or the Internet. To further increase the security of your RackConnect environment, you also have the ability to use the Rackspace dedicated intrusion detection system (IDS) and web application firewall (WAF) offerings.</p>

<p>RackConnect is also compatible with our dedicated&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/service-levels/" target="_blank">Managed and Intensive</a>&nbsp;service levels&nbsp;and cloud&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/" target="_blank">Managed Operations and Managed Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;service levels, giving you the ability to select the level of&nbsp;<em>Fanatical SupportÂ®</em>&nbsp;that you need to properly manage your hybrid environment.</p>
