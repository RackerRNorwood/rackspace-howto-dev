<h3>Product Overview</h3><p>Cloud Queues is an open-source messaging system, designed to help customers build and scale distributed applications in the cloud. &nbsp;The Cloud Queues API is built to be flexible, supporting a variety of messaging patterns like producer-consumer, poll based publisher-subscriber, and point-to-point. &nbsp;</p><p>Queuing systems like Cloud Queues are meant to decouple resources in an application by serving as a communication layer between those resources. &nbsp;Instead of a server in an application telling another server do to a task, they post a message to a queue. &nbsp;Then, the server performing work can check that queue for work when it is available. &nbsp;This prevents an application from slowing down due to servers being busy, offline, unavailable, etc. &nbsp;Using Cloud Queues as a middle layer means that servers producing work can post messages to the queue as quickly as needed, without caring if a server is available to do that work. &nbsp;Servers working on tasks can easily be scaled up and down as needed. For pricing and service information, please see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/queues/" target="_blank">the Cloud Queues product page</a> on our website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Example Use Cases</h3><p>Most distributed applications will have the need for a queuing system, but here are some specific examples for some common messaging patterns:</p><p><em><strong>Producer-Consumer</strong></em>- &nbsp;A producer-consumer model is the most popular way to use a queuing system. &nbsp;A good example of this is a website that allows users to signup for the company's newsletter. &nbsp;As customers fill out the online form, they need to be sent a confirmation email to ensure they own the email address. &nbsp;Web servers responsible for running the website will place a message on a queue every time a customer submits their form, "send_conf_email" for example. &nbsp;Applications servers responsible for sending email will be checking the queue every minute to see if any new jobs are ready to for work. &nbsp;A server will claim the message, ensuring no other servers attempt to do the same work, it will complete the tasks, and then delete the message, signifying the task is complete. &nbsp;Many applications will use multiple queues for different types of tasks. &nbsp;For example, another job called "update_salesforce" may be triggered by this same event. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Publisher-Subscriber</strong></em>- &nbsp;The publisher-subscriber pattern is often used as the underlying component of a notifications service. &nbsp;One of the most common examples is an RSS feed. &nbsp;Customers signup online to receive alerts when an event happens, for example, when their company name is mentioned in an online article. &nbsp;In this example, there is an agent looking online at all times for certain keywords. &nbsp;As it finds articles, a message will be posted to the queue that contains the article's information. &nbsp;Servers responsible for alerting, the "subscribers" in this case, will poll the queue every 1-5 minutes to see if any new updates have been posted. &nbsp;If so, they will email anyone who has signed up for updates. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please see the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-queues-faq" target="_blank">Cloud Queues FAQ</a> for more information on features, limits, support, and more. &nbsp;</p>
