<p>Rackspace Private Cloud Software downloads Ubuntu installation files as part of the installation process to ensure that you have the most up-to-date operating system that works with our software. If the node doesn't have internet access, the installation process will fail. You may also experience issues if the node is behind a firewall.</p>
