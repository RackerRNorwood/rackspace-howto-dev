[Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint:
Overview](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-overview)

When you are working in Rackspace Cloud Storage App *for Microsoft
SharePoint*, you can choose to remove the stored credentials by clicking
the **Log Out** button.

You are then prompted to confirm that you want to log out.

If you choose to log out, the credentials that the app previously
recorded are deleted. Until credentials are once again supplied, you
will be returned to the configuration screen each time you access the
app.

The last topic in the **Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint**
series describes the [Browser Compatibility
