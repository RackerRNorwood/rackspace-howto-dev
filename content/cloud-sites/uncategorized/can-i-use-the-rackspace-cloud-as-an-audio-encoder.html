<p>The Rackspace Cloud isn't afraid of the facts. And the fact is, audio encoding is a good example of a task that a dedicated server is better suited for. We built Cloud Sites to be a highly specialized and optimized computer cluster for serving web content. That means it's not really designed for audio processing or streaming tasks. It's okay to have some audio content on Cloud Sites (if you own the copyrights, of course), but it's not meant to be a processing farm for audio conversion or a ShoutCast system to use for live audio streaming.</p>
