<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to a feature that is no longer available for Cloud Sites. It is provided for legacy support only.</p>

<p>You can access a mobile version of the webmail client by going to <a class="external text" href="http://mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile" rel="nofollow" title="http://mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile">mail.emailsrvr.com/mobile</a>.</p>

<p>You can also substitute your domain for <strong>emailsrvr.com</strong> when pointing to our name servers or if you have the appropriate CNAME records set up on your current name servers. (If you're pointing to our name servers, then by default&nbsp;these records are set up, unless you modified them.)</p>

<p>For instructions for setting up email on your mobile devices, see the following articles:</p>
