<p>In this article we discuss how to add a reverse DNS record (also known as an RDNS record and a PTR record) to map your server's IP address to a domain name (for example, 1.2.3.4. to example.com). We use the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<h3><a id="why" name="why">Why reverse DNS lookups?</a></h3>

<p>Reverse DNS records are essential for those running a mail server since many recipient servers reject, or mark as spam, all email that originates from an "unauthenticated" server.</p>

<p>This means that after the sending IP address is checked, if the reverse DNS does not match the sending domain, then it is classed as “unauthenticated”.</p>

<p>We put ”unauthenticated” in quotes because having a Reverse DNS record attached to your domain does not automatically guarantee acceptance of email originating from your domain by the recipient's email server. It's just that non-matching or generic reverse DNS lookup settings are often rejected out of hand. Having a reverse DNS record for your domain will prevent email originating from your domain from getting immediately rejected.</p>

<p>RDNS can also be very useful when tracking down network issues and was the original driving force of RDNS. When pinging a website or IP address, one part of the output is the server's RDNS record.</p>

<h3><a name="how">How does it work?</a></h3>

<p>When you enter a domain name into your browser, the DNS system will find the IP address of the server the domain is associated with.</p>

<p>A reverse DNS lookup does the opposite. It establishes what domain is associated with the IP address. This is a useful setting to configure for anyone, but it is essential for customers running an outgoing mail server on their Cloud Server.</p>

<h3><a name="setup">How do I set it up?</a></h3>

<p>You can easily set up reverse DNS through the control panel. Just perform these steps:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li>Log in to your Rackspace account with the <a href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>On the Servers tab, click the link for your Cloud Server from your Servers List.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Server Details</strong> screen, click <strong>Add Record</strong> next to the Reverse DNS.

	</li>
	<li>In the Add Record pop-up window:
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Enter you domain name (for example “mail.example.com”) in the <strong>Hostname</strong> field.</li>
		<li>Set the Time to Live (TTL) for the record.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Save Record</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Back at the Server Details screen, you will now see 1 record listed next to Reverse DNS. Click this link to display the details for the reverse DNS you just added.
