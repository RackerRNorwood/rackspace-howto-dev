<p>Rackspace Metrics lets you build a Grafana dashboard to visualize your metrics. Instead of using a stand-alone graphite back end, you can point your Grafana instance to the Rackspace Metrics service. You can complete all these steps directly from the Cloud Control Panel by importing a custom template and then creating a stack from this template.</p>

<p>This article describes how to deploy a Grafana instance for Rackspace Metrics by using a custom Cloud Orchestration template. It also provides instructions on how to upload a Grafana dashboard for a database instance.</p>

<h2>Deploy the Grafana instance for Rackspace Metrics</h2>

<p>To create a Grafana dashboard complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the&nbsp;<a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" title="Cloud Control Panel">Rackspace Cloud Control Panel</a>&nbsp;with your user name and password.</li>
	<li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Servers</strong>&nbsp;section, click&nbsp;<strong>Create Stack</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Create&nbsp;Custom&nbsp;Template</strong>.</li>
	<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://bitly.com/heat-grafana">https://bitly.com/heat-grafana</a>, and copy the content on the page. This is the template that you will be using to create your stack.</li>
	<li>Go back to the Cloud Control Panel.</li>
	<li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Create Custom Template</strong>&nbsp;page, perform the following steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Enter a name for the template.</li>
		<li>Paste the template content that you just copied</li>
		<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Validate Syntax </strong>at the bottom of the page.<br />
		After the template has been successfully validated, an It works! message is displayed beside the button.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Create Template</strong>.<br />
	Your template is now being created. This may take a few minutes. After the template is complete, you will see a page that displays information about your custom template, including a description.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="297" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-customized-template1.png" width="513" /><br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, choose <strong>Create Stack from Template</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Create Stack</strong>&nbsp;page, enter a name for the stack and then enter values for the following fields under <strong>Server Settings</strong>. Use the values for your Rackspace account, and overwrite the “not valid” values that are populated by default.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>API key</strong></li>
		<li><strong>username</strong></li>
		<li><strong>tenant ID </strong>(which is also referred to as your account number)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Create Stack</strong>.<br />
	The stack details page is displayed.<br />
	While the stack is being built, you can see a "Building" message in the <strong>Status</strong> field.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="380" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-create-stack-building.png" width="449" /><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>When the stack has finished building, the&nbsp;<strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;field changes to <strong>Up</strong>. The page also displays an IP address, a Grafana auth password, and a Grafana auth username that you can use to access your Grafana dashboard. Be sure to record this information.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="616" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-metrics-up1.png" width="408" /></p>

<h2>Use the Grafana dashboard</h2>

<p>Now that you have created your stack, you can access the Grafana dashboard that contains all the relevant information for your stack.</p>

<p>To access the Grafana dashboard, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open a web browser.</li>
	<li>Type the IP address in the address bar. You are prompted with an authentication page<br />
	Type the username and password that were displayed after you created the stack and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
	Your Grafana dashboard is displayed.<br />
	Type the username and password you were presented with after creating the stack and click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
	You should now be able to see your grafana dashboard.<br />
	<br />

</ol>

<p>Note that all of the metrics submitted by Rackspace Cloud Monitoring are displayed in the following format:</p>

<p><code>“rackspace.monitoring.entities.&lt;entityid&gt;.checks.&lt;checktype&gt;.&lt;checkid&gt;.&lt;metricname&gt;”.</code></p>

<h3>Locate your entity and check Ids</h3>

<p>Cloud Monitoring generates entity IDs and check IDs to guarantee the uniqueness of the metrics.</p>

<p>You can locate the entity ID and check ID on the&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Intelligence</a>&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring Details</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Check Details </strong>pages.</p>

<p>For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-rackspace-intelligence-for-the-cloud">Getting Started with Rackspace Intelligence for the Cloud</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence">Monitoring entities with Rackspace Intelligence</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/working-with-checks">Working with checks</a>.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows where you can locate the entity ID on the&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring Details</strong>&nbsp;page.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-monitoring-details_0.png" /></p>

<p>You can also locate the monitoring and check IDs by looking at the Rackspace Intelligence URL for a particular check. The following is an example of such a URL:</p>

<p><code>https://intelligence.rackspace.com/cloud/entities/enrmO7n1hX/checks/ch6fvLIaMC</code></p>

<p>The entity ID directly follows the&nbsp;entities&nbsp;parameter. Entity IDs always start with the letters <em>en</em>. The check ID directly follows the&nbsp;checks&nbsp;parameter. Check IDs always start with the letters <em>ch</em>.</p>

<h2>Upload a Grafana dashboard for database instances</h2>

<p>Rackspace has created a Grafana dashboard to help you get set up with your Cloud Databases MySQL instances.</p>

<p>To upload a Grafana dashboard that shows your database MySQL instances, complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download the Grafana dashboard JSON file from <a href="http://bit.ly/mysql-grafana">http://bit.ly/mysql-grafana</a>.</li>
	<li>Modify the JSON to match your instance by replacing all the instances of _rax_entity_id_ in the file with the entity ID of your database instance.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" height="76" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-replace-entty-id1.png" width="639" /></li>
	<li>On the Grafana dashboard, click&nbsp;<strong>Import</strong>&nbsp;on the top-right corner, click&nbsp;<strong>Browse</strong>, and then upload the file to Grafana.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="184" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/grafana-JSON-file-upload.png" width="432" /><br />
	<br />
	The dashboard automatically appears and displays your MySQL database instances.<br />

<h2>Grafana FAQ</h2>

<p>Q: How much does Grafana cost?</p>

<p>A: You pay only for the cost of the server you create. Everything else is no cost.</p>

<p>Grafana is an open-source metrics dashboard and graph editor. There is no cost to the software itself. You can choose to deploy it anywhere and you are responsible only for maintaining and paying for the server it runs on.</p>

<p>We want you to have access to your metrics so you can make informed decisions about your infrastructure. Our monitoring service is no cost, and so are the metrics that we store.</p>

<p>Q: Should I use Rackspace Intelligence or Grafana?</p>

<p>A: <a href="http://intelligence.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Intelligence</a>&nbsp;is another no-cost option that we provide to help you make your infrastructure choices. It is designed to answer the most obvious questions that anyone asks about their servers. Although it covers many use cases and has a certain amount of customization, if you want total customizability, you can use Grafana as an alternative.</p>

<p>As an additional comparison, Rackspace Intelligence does more than just graphs; it is a control panel that enables you to manage your Cloud Monitoring configuration. Although Grafana might give you total control over your graphs, Rackspace Intelligence gives you total control to create, delete, and edit your monitoring configuration.</p>

<p>Rackspace Intelligence and Grafana are using the same metrics stored in the Rackspace Metrics service. This means that you can try both and choose the one that works well for you.
