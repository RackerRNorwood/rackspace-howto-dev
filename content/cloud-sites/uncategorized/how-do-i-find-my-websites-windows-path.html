<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p>When you configure some ASP or ASP.NET web applications, you might need to provide the absolute path, full path, or web root for your website. If your web application uses ASP, ASP.NET, or your default site technology is Windows, you'll typically want to use the Windows web directory. If don't know whether you need the Windows or Linux path, consult a web developer or the web application vendor, or contact support for a recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need to find your website's Linux path, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/78">Locate the Linux path for your Cloud Sites website</a>.</p>

<h2>To find the websiteâ€™s Windows path</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left navigation pane, click <strong>Hosting &gt; Cloud Sites</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click on the name of the website for which you need to obtain the Windows path.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Features</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page to the <strong>Server-side Paths</strong> section.<br />
	Under <strong>Windows Info</strong>, the absolute path to your ASP Windows site is the one labeled <strong>Web directory</strong>. The path should resemble the following format: <strong>\\fs1-n01\stor1wc1dfw1\123456\www.domain.com\web\content\</strong></li>
</ol>
