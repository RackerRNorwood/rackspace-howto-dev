<p><strong>APPLIES TO</strong>: RackConnect v2.0</p>

<p>Programmatically querying the RackConnect Automation status of your Cloud Servers can help you determine when a new Cloud Server build has completed the RackConnect Automation process and is fully 'Deployed' with RackConnect. RackConnect Automation status and enabled features can be determined programmatically using the RackConnect API or the Cloud Servers API.</p>

<h2>Utilizing the RackConnect API</h2>

<p>The RackConnect API can be used to query RackConnect Automation status from any of your Cloud Servers. It also allows you to query the RackConnect Gateway IP, Automation Status, Automation Status Details, and the Automation Features. If you would like to utilize the RackConnect API, please view the following article for further details:&nbsp;<a href="//www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/the-rackconnect-api">The RackConnect API</a></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>Utilizing the Next Generation Cloud Servers API to query your Cloud Servers' MetaData</h2>

<p>You may also use the Cloud Servers API to query the RackConnect Automation Status of your Cloud Servers. The benefits of using this method are that you do not need to query the status from within the same Cloud Server you would like the status of. To utilize this method, query the Cloud Servers API and look for the metadata key named “<strong>rackconnect_automation_status</strong>” on any of your Cloud Servers. The value of the “rackconnect_automation_status” metadata key will be the current automation status of your Cloud Server in RackConnect (accurate within a few seconds after each change). The automation status is in the form of “DEPLOYING, DEPLOYED, FAILED, or UNPROCESSABLE.”&nbsp; The "metadata" entries will now also show what RackConnect Automation Features are currently enabled on your account and consist of the following keys: "<strong>rackconnect_automation_feature_configure_network_stack</strong>", "<strong>rackconnect_automation_feature_manage_software_firewall</strong>", and "<strong>rackconnect_automation_feature_provison_public_ip</strong>".</p>

<p>Here is an example of the metadata keys/values now available for RackConnect:</p>

<pre>
"metadata": {
"rackconnect_automation_feature_configure_network_stack": "ENABLED", 
"rackconnect_automation_feature_manage_software_firewall": "ENABLED", 
"rackconnect_automation_feature_provison_public_ip": "ENABLED", 
"rackconnect_automation_status": "DEPLOYED"
},</pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The "UNPROCESSABLE" status normally occurs when you build a cloud server in a region that does not match your RackConnect Configuration region.</p>

<h3>Obtaining the metadata information via the next-generation Cloud Servers API (Examples)</h3>

<p><strong>Authenticate and obtain an Auth Token:</strong></p>

<p>You will first need to Authenticate and obtain an Auth Token. The following curl command is one way of accomplishing this. You will need to enter the command with your Cloud Account's password and username credentials in the &lt;Cloud UserName&gt; and &lt;Cloud Password&gt; fields:</p>

<pre>
curl -s https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens -X 'POST' -d '{"auth":{"passwordCredentials":{"username":"&lt;Cloud UserName&gt;", "password":"&lt;Cloud Password&gt;"}}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" | python -m json.tool</pre>

<p>The results for running this query will display a "token" section, and you will need to copy the "id" value.&nbsp; The auth token "id" will look similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
"id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx"</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Show details for a standard or workload-optimized Cloud Server to view the "metadata" values:</strong></p>

<p>Using the auth token, you can query a Cloud Server's details, in order to view the RackConnect metadata keys related to RackConnect. The following curl command is one way of accomplishing this. You will need to enter the command with your Cloud Account's Number, the Server ID of the Cloud Server you'd like to query, and the Auth Token obtained in the previous step. These values will be entered into the &lt;Cloud Account Number&gt;, &lt;Server ID&gt;, and XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX fields.</p>

<pre>
curl -s https://ord.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/&lt;Cloud Account Number&gt;/servers/&lt;Server ID&gt; -H "X-Auth-Token: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx" | python -m json.tool</pre>

<p><em>Note: Do not include the &lt; &gt; brackets when entering your values.</em></p>

<p>This is just a brief introduction to get you started on using the Cloud Servers API to query the RackConnect statuses of your Cloud Servers; if you require further information on the Cloud Servers API, please view the following articles:</p>

Utilizing the First Generation Cloud Servers API to query your Cloud Servers' MetaData</h2>

<p>You may also use the First Generation Cloud Servers API to query the RackConnect Automation Status of First Generation&nbsp;Cloud Servers. The benefits of using this method are that you do not need to query the status from within the same Cloud Server you would like the status of. To utilize this method, query the First Generation&nbsp;Cloud Servers API and look for the metadata key named “<strong>rackconnect_automation_status</strong>” on any of your First Generation&nbsp;Cloud Servers.

Obtaining the metadata information via the First Generation Cloud Servers API (Examples)</h3>

<p><strong>Authenticate and obtain an X-Auth-Token:</strong></p>

<p>You will first need to Authenticate and obtain a X-Auth-Token. The following curl command is one way of accomplishing this. You will need to enter the command with your Cloud Account's API Key and Username credentials in the &lt;Cloud Account's API Key&gt; and &lt;Cloud Account Username&gt; fields:</p>

<pre>
curl -D - -k -H "X-Auth-Key: &lt;Cloud Account's API Key&gt;" -H "X-Auth-User: &lt;Cloud Account Username&gt;" https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0</pre>

<p>The results from running this query will display a "X-Auth-Token:" entry, and you will need to copy the value associated with this entry.&nbsp; The "X-Auth-Token:" entry will look similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
X-Auth-Token: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</pre>

<p><strong>Show details for a Cloud Server to view the "metadata" values:</strong></p>

<p>Using the X-Auth-Token, you can now query a Cloud Server's details, in order to view the metadata keys/values associated with RackConnect. The following curl command is one way of accomplishing this. You will need to enter the command with your Cloud Account's Number, the Server ID of the Cloud Server you'd like to query, and the Auth Token obtained in the previous step. These values will be entered into the X-Auth-Token XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX, &lt;Cloud Account Number&gt;, and &lt;Server ID&gt; fields.</p>

<pre>
curl -k -X GET -D - -H "X-Auth-Token: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" https://servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/&lt;Cloud Account Number&gt;/servers/&lt;Server ID&gt;</pre>

<h2>Determining when the Managed Operations Post-Build Automation Process is Complete</h2>

<p>As part of an effort to improve your experience with RackConnect, we made an automation change that affects RackConnect customers with the Managed Operations service level. This change is transparent for the majority of customers -- including those using the MyRackspace Portal or the Cloud Control Panel to provision servers -- but may require changes for any customers who performed automated processes or configuration on their servers immediately after the RackConnect automation completed.</p>

<p><strong>When is this change going to take place?</strong><br />
This change has already been implemented.</p>

<p><strong>What was changed?</strong><br />
For RackConnect customers with the Managed Operations service level, there are two distinct automation routines that run after a Cloud Server is built. Previously, automation for Managed Operations ran first, followed by RackConnect automation. We reversed the order of automation so that RackConnect runs first.</p>

<p><strong>Why was this change made?</strong><br />
We determined that we can reduce post-build automation failures and improve your RackConnect experience by making this change. By allowing RackConnect automation to run first, we can more quickly and more reliably deliver a RackConnect Cloud Server to you.</p>

<p><strong>Who does this affect?</strong><br />
This change affected all RackConnect customers with the Managed Operations service level.<br />
For the limited set of customers who leverage their own configuration management scripts, please note that RackConnect automation runs first, followed by Managed Operations automation. We highly recommend that you adjust your post-build configuration management to note when Managed Operations automation is complete; this will be the new trigger to start any post-build configuration tasks you wish to run.</p>

<p><strong>How can I tell when Managed Operations post-build automation is complete?</strong></p>

<p>For Windows Cloud Servers:<br />
Upon successful completion, the following file will be created:</p>

<pre>
C:\windows\temp\rs_managed_cloud_automation_complete.txt</pre>

<p>For Linux Cloud Servers:<br />
Upon successful completion, the following file will be created:</p>

<pre>
/tmp/rs_managed_cloud_automation_complete</pre>

<p><strong>Obtaining the Managed Operations post-build automation status via the Cloud Servers API:</strong></p>

<p>For standard and workload-optimized Cloud Servers only, you may also obtain the Managed Operations post-build automation status via the Cloud Servers API.&nbsp; To accomplish this, you would follow the same process described above in the "Obtaining the metadata information via the Cloud Servers API (Examples)" section, but this time, you would be looking for the metadata key value "<strong>rax_service_level_automation</strong>".&nbsp; The "<strong>rax_service_level_automation</strong>" metadata key will have a value of "Pending", "In Progress", "Complete", "Build Error" or "Authentication Error", depending on the current status of the Managed Cloud post-build automation process.</p>

<p><strong>Who can I contact if I have any questions?</strong><br />
Should you have any questions about RackConnect, Managed Operations, or this change, please don't hesitate to contact your Rackspace Support team.</p>
