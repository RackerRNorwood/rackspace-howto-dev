<p>When you upload a file in the Cloud Control Panel, an Allow-Origin header is set on the container to support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Browsers prevent AJAX requests between different domains by default. Because the Cloud Files API and the Control Panel reside on different domains, CORS must be enabled to support uploads directly to a container. When the upload succeeds, the CORS headers are removed.</p><p>By allowing the browser to upload directly to the Cloud Files API, maximum upload performance can be achieved.</p><p>Read more about CORS at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
