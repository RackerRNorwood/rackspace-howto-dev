<p>When performing an email migration, some customers might need to restrict access to a defined set of IP addresses, typically for security reasons.&nbsp; This article provides the range of IP addresses from which our MigrationWiz tool can connect, and instructions on locking down your migration to only these specific IP addresses. &nbsp;</p><p>Note: Due to the restricted IP range, migration speeds are not optimal.&nbsp; Consider this when planning your migration timeline. &nbsp;</p><h3>IP Address Ranges</h3><ul><li>192.34.111.0 to 192.34.111.63 (aka 192.34.111.0/26) new</li><li>208.115.102.1 to 208.115.102.63 (aka 208.115.102.1/26)</li><li>198.104.255.65 to 198.104.255.126 (aka 198.104.255.64/26)</li><li>4.53.159.1 to 4.53.159.126 (aka 4.53.159.0/25)</li><li>216.176.189.162 to 216.176.189.188</li><li>198.104.202.70</li><li>4.53.158.186</li></ul><h3>To Lock Down Your Migration Profile</h3><p>Now that you have the range of IP addresses, you need to lock down your migration profile. &nbsp;If your migration is assisted, your migration specialist performs these actions. &nbsp;If you are performing the migration yourself, complete the following steps.</p><p>1.
