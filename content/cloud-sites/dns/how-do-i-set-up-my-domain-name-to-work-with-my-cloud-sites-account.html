<p>You can use the following methods to set up your domain name to work with your Cloud Sites web hosting account:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/638">Registering a domain name through the control panel</a></li>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/652">Transferring the registrar of an existing domain name</a></li>
	<li><a href="/knowledge_center/node/100">Updating your existing name servers to Rackspace name servers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All DNS changes take up to 48 hours to take effect. During this time you can check your website by using the <em>testing URL</em>, which you can find on the Cloud Sites Control Panel, on the <strong>General Settings</strong> tab for your domain.</p>
