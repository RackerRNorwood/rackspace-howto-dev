Cloud Sites webmail accounts provide 1GB of storage space.  If you reach
the quota and wish to delete or purge messages in order to free up
space, you'll need to make the following changes:

1.  Log into your webmail account.

2.  Go to the webmail settings (3 lines on upper left corner).

3.  In the General Settings tab you will go to the Email Options section
and deselect the following options:

-Move deleted email to the Trash folder\
 -Move purged email to the Trash folder

Once you have saved the changes you can then delete or purge messages. 
If you would like to see which folders contain the most messages you can
go to the "Folder Manager", which is the gold button next to the Inbox. 
This will provide you with the option to "Update Sizes" as well as purge
folders.
