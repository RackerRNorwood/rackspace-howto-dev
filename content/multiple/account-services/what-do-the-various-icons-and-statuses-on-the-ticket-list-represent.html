<p>To see how to create a Rackspace support ticket, watch <a href="/knowledge_center/video/how-to-create-a-support-ticket">a brief video</a>.</p>

<p>After you create a support ticket, it can have one of the following statuses, depending on the work done on it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>New</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Feedback received</strong></li>
	<li><strong>In progress</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Pending your response</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Transferred&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Solved</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Closed</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The following process explains how a ticket moves through these statuses:</p>

<ol>
	<li>As soon as a Rackspace Cloud customer opens a ticket, it has a status of <strong>New</strong>.</li>
	<li>When a ticket has been seen by a member of Rackspace Cloud support team, it has a status of <strong>Feedback Received.</strong></li>
	<li>After a ticket is reviewed by the Rackspace Cloud support team, it moves to the <strong>In Progress</strong> or <strong>Solved</strong> status.</li>
	<li>If the support team needs more information from the customer to fix the issue, the ticket might move to the <strong>Pending your response</strong> status.</li>
	<li>If a ticket moves to another member of the support team, it has a status of <strong>Transferred</strong>.</li>
	<li>After a ticket has a status of <strong>Solved</strong>, a customer can move the ticket to <strong>Closed</strong> or reopen it, which changes the status to <strong>In progress</strong>.</li>
	<li>If a customer does not explicitly close or reopen a ticket with a <strong>Solved</strong> status, the ticket automatically goes to the <strong>Closed</strong> status in seven days.</li>
</ol>
