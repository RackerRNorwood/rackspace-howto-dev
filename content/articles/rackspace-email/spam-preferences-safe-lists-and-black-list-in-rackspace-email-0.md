**Managing Safe List**
----------------------

Safelists allow you to add a sender's email address, domains, or IP
address to deliver directly to the mailbox. This is useful when a sender
is flagged as spam and you would like to allow this email not deliver to
the Spam/Junk Folder.

To manage your Safe List, select **Safelists**

*Note: For Indivudal Mailboxes, select **Safelists** in the **Rackspace
Email** section. For the domain, select **Safelists** in the **Domains**
Section.*
