<p><strong><strong>APPLIES TO</strong></strong>: RackConnect v2.0</p>

<h3><strong>Does RackConnect support cloud servers that are part of a Cloud Network?</strong></h3>

<p>RackConnect support for Cloud Networks is available as of January 16, 2013.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT: Can I attach/detach a Cloud Network on a running RackConnected Cloud Server?</h3>

<p>Attaching/detaching a Cloud Network on a running RackConnected Cloud Server causes the network stack to be reset, which will break the cloud server's RackConnect connectivity.&nbsp; Therefore, we do not recommend attaching or detaching Cloud Networks to running RackConnect servers.&nbsp; If you do need to attach or detach a network, please contact your Support team prior to making the change.</p>

<h3><strong>What are the requirements for using Cloud Networks with RackConnect?</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>You must be a RackConnect 2.0 with Automation Features enabled customer.&nbsp; For further details on RackConnect Automation Features, please view the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-automation-features-faq">RackConnect Automation Features FAQ</a>.</li>
	<li>You must make sure to create cloud servers with the PublicNet and ServiceNet networks enabled, in addition to your Cloud Network.&nbsp; These PublicNet and ServiceNet networks are selected by default, and as a RackConnect customer you will not be able to uncheck them, in the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com"> my.rackspace.com </a>portal or the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>.&nbsp; But, if you are using the Cloud Servers API to create cloud servers, there are API options that allow you to create cloud servers without the PublicNet and/or ServiceNet networks, so to avoid RackConnect failures, please be sure you do *not* disable the PublicNet and/or ServiceNet networks when using the API to create new cloud servers.</li>
	<li>Since RackConnect controls the software firewalls on your cloud servers via Network Policies, you will also need to create a RackConnect Network Policy to allow communication between the cloud servers across the Cloud Network.&nbsp; The Network Policy should be configured as follows:<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>The<strong> Access Scenario</strong> should be set to "Dedicated to Cloud Server(s)"</li>
	<li>The <strong>Source Server Network</strong> should be set to the network configured for your Cloud Network</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of how the Network Policy should be configured to allow connectivity across your Cloud Network IP addresses.&nbsp; In this example, the Cloud Network is equal to 192.168.x.x/24.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="image-half_width" src="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/styles/half_width/public/field/image/CloudNetworks.NetworkPolicy.png" title="" /></p>

<p><em>Note: This Network Policy will need to be created, even if you already have a "Cloud Server(s) to Cloud Server(s)" Network Policy allowing all traffic.</em></p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What network ranges can I use with Cloud Networks for RackConnected cloud servers?</strong></h3>

<p>Cloud Networks itself normally supports any network range, but if you plan to use the Cloud Network with RackConnected cloud servers, we suggest you limit the network ranges you use to the following Private Address Spaces:</p>

<ul>
	<li>10.x.x.x/8 <strong>*</strong></li>
	<li>172.16.x.x/12 -&gt; 172.31.x.x/12<strong>*</strong></li>
	<li>192.168.x.x/16 <strong>*</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>* IMPORTANT *</strong></p>

<p><strong>When creating Cloud Networks, please follow the following guidelines to avoid connectivity issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Avoid using a network range that overlaps with 10.176.0.0/12 or 10.208.0.0/12.</strong></li>
	<li><strong><strong>Avoid using</strong> a network range that is already in use in your Dedicated environment.</strong></li>
	<li><strong><strong>Avoid using Public IP address network ranges.</strong></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Can I use RackConnect and Cloud Networks to create one large Layer 2 Broadcast Domain that spans my Dedicated and Cloud environments?</strong></h3>

<p>In other words, can you have a single network, let's say 192.168.x.x/24, for your dedicated servers and also for your cloud servers, so that they can communicate like they are all on the same network?&nbsp; Currently, the answer is <strong>no.&nbsp;</strong> Your cloud servers connect to RackConnect via a ServiceNet NIC, and a separate Cloud Networks NIC is used for Cloud Networks connectivity.&nbsp; The ServiceNet Network and the Cloud Network are two distinct networks that do not have direct connectivity between them.&nbsp; The diagram below should help you to visualize how RackConnect and Cloud Networks work on the same cloud server.&nbsp; In the diagram Cloud Private Network is equivalent to the Cloud ServiceNet Network.</p>
