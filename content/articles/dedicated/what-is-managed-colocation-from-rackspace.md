undefined&reg; optional services such as [Managed
Backup](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/storage/managedbackup.php),
Managed [Private
Clouds](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/private_cloud/index.php)
and [Managed
Storage](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/storage/index.php)
to name a few. We give you the necessary tools to remotely administer
your environment, as well as have access to our 24x7x365 remote hands
and eyes in the data center. No more having to rush into the data center
with spare parts at 2am to replace failed hardware. No more having to
send out a team of technicians to your colocation facility to get a
20-device configuration racked, cabled, imaged and ready to go.  
**Dedicated Support Team**   With Rackspace Managed Colocation, you get
a dedicated support team to assist you with your configuration 24x7x365.
 

-   Your dedicated **Account Manager (AM)** is your main point of
    contact at Rackspace. The AM knows your configuration and works
    closely with the support team to address any issues should they
    arise.
-   Your **Deployment Team** is there for initial deployments as well as
    configuration changes and space planning. The Deployment Team works
    closely with the datacenters to ensure that your configuration is
    racked and cabled to your specifications.
-   The **Network Engineering** team configures your network devices,
    offers consultation for network changes and assists with
    troubleshooting tasks. They act as an extension of your in-house
    networking team.
-   Our **Support Specialists** are available to assist with support
    issues and escalation. They are available 24x7x365 to address
    technical issues.

  While traditional colocation allows you to maintain a high level of
control, it can also present a significant level of inconvenience and
responsibility. Rackspace Managed Colocation provides the OS control you
need with the support and expertise you want.
