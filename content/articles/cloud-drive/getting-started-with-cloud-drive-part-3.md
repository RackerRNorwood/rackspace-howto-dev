***Note:** We no longer accept new sign-ups for Cloud Drive, though it
is still supported for existing customers. New customers should use the
[equivalent service offered via JungleDisk](https://jungledisk.com/)
instead.*

### Prerequisites

Drive](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-disks-access-for-cloud-drive)

Creating Online Disk(s) allows administrators to create more than one
disk for each user. This can be beneficial if you have two different
groups of users who need to access to different data. Let's take a look
below on how to set this up: 

### Creating Online Disk(s):

1. First thing will do is login into your cloud drive control panel
(e.g, http://example.myjungledisk.com). Once you're logged in,
select **Online Disk Management** link under **Workgroup**.

2. Create an Online Disk Name (e.g., finance, documents, sales) and
then select the following options that apply:

-   Storage Provider - Select a storage company. This will be the data
    host for the online disk.

-   Location - Select the location for your data storage.

-   Reporting User - Select a user that this disk will be listed under
    when running reports.

-   Enabled Features - Select disk features as desired.

-   Local Drive Mapping - The user can map the disk on their computer
    just like a network drive.

-   Sync Folders - The user can select files and folders to
    automatically sync between the online disk and their computer.

-   Automatic Backup - The user can schedule backups for selected
    folders or drives and restore data from the online disk.

-   Security - Select the level of security. High security will give
    users the option of entering a password.

3. Select the **Create Online Disk** button when you're finished.

**Note**: Under the User Access section, you can add users and set their
level of access. To learn how to set user access to multiple disks, move
