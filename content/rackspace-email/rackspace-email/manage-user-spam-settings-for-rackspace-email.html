Note: Email will be permanently deleted and will not be retrievable.</li></ul><ul><li>Include "[SPAM]" at the beginning of the subject line—Spam email will be delivered to the user's Inbox, but will include the text "[SPAM]" in the Subject line.</li></ul><ul><li>Deliver to the email address—Spam messages are sent to an address in your domain that you specify.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>Exchange Handling</h2><ul><li>Send spam to the quarantine for this recipient—Each Exchange mailbox has its own Quarantine Manager, located in the User Control Panel. (Note: Users can log into the User Control Panel at <a href="https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp">https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp</a>, using their Exchange email address and password.) Email that is filtered as spam will be directed to the Quarantine Manager, where the user can then view and delete quarantined emails, or mark them as <strong>Not Spam</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li>Send spam to domain quarantine—Spam will be directed to the domain-level quarantine, rather than to the individual Quarantine Manager for the mailbox.</li></ul><p><em>Note: To log into the domain-level Quarantine Manager, click the <strong>Log into the Quarantine Manager</strong> link, located in the <strong>Exchange Handling</strong> section of the entire domain spam settings page.) Email that is filtered as spam will be directed to the domain-level Quarantine Manager, where the administrator can then view and delete quarantined emails, or mark them as <strong>Not Spam</strong>.</em></p><ul><li>Send quarantine notifications to—If you choose to send spam to the user's quarantine, they will receive quarantine updates by default. To receive email updates at an additional address, enter an email address in the <strong>Send quarantine notifications to</strong> box.</li></ul><p>8. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>
