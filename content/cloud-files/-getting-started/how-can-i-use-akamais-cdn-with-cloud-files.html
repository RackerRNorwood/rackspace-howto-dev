<p>Rackspace Cloud Files uses&nbsp;<a class="external text" title="http://www.akamai.com/" href="http://www.akamai.com/" rel="nofollow">Akamai Technologies, Inc</a>. a leading, tier one, global Content Delivery Network (CDN) provider to offer the benefits to all Cloud Files users. &nbsp;Today Akamai handles tens of billions of daily Web interactions for their customers such as Audi, NBC, Fujitsu, U.S. Department of Defense, and NASDAQ.</p><p>The Rackspace CloudFiles/Akamai relationship brings full-fledged, robust CDN capabilities and unlimited file storage to developers and corporate IT departments alike. The CDN capability will greatly enhance the quality of the end user experience by speeding the delivery of bandwidth-heavy rich content, including audio and video. For literally pennies per gigabyte of bandwidth and storage and no upfront commitments, the CDN advantage is now available to all not just to the giants of the internet. This partnership brings unlimited online storage, scalable content delivery, and application acceleration services, thereby allowing businesses to more easily and affordably distribute content to millions of end users around the world. Together with Akamai, Rackspace has democratized content delivery.</p><p>With Akamai’s service, Cloud Files brings a powerful and easy way to publish content over a world-class, industry leading CDN. A Cloud Files user automatically gets access to this network. Users have to mark containers for publishing to CDN, and then they are instantly accessible through Akamai CDN. The propagation of content to the edge locations is done automatically behind the scenes. The Rackspace Cloud/Akamai offering is not a one-off solution; content published through it is distributed across their entire infrastructure just as it is for other customers.</p><p>In the Rackspace Cloud control panel, it is a matter of creating a Container (the storage compartment for data), uploading Objects (the files to serve over CDN), and marking the Container as “public”. The Container is then assigned a unique URL which can be combined with Object names to embed in web pages, email messages, blog posts, etc. For example, a user could upload a photo to a Container called “images”. When this Container is published, it will be assigned a unique URL like <code>http://c0000532.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspace.com</code>. The user could then share a link to the photo with link like <code>http://c0000532.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspace.com/IMG_3432.jpg</code>. When that link is accessed, the photo is served from the CDN; it’s that simple!</p>
