<p>If you recently migrated to Exchange 2010 or have been using Outlook 2010, you might see synchronization errors that appear as unread emails and continue to increase. Microsoft is currently working to resolve this issue, but in the interim you can use the following workaround.</p>

<h2>Customize the search folders</h2>

<ol>
	<li>In the navigation pane of your Outlook email view, expand the&nbsp;<strong>Search Folders </strong>folder.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="378" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1_55.png" width="326" /></li>
	<li>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Unread Mail</strong>&nbsp;folder and select&nbsp;<strong>Customize This Search Folder</strong>.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="170" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/2_52.png" width="301" /><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Browse</strong>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Clear the <strong>Search subfolders </strong>check box at the bottom of the dialog box.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" border="2" height="316" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/3a.png" width="346" /><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the Select Folder(s) window, uncheck all folders except for the Inbox. If there are any rules that move new emails into any other folder, you will want to include those also.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong> again to confirm.</li>
</ol>
