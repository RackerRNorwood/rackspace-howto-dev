<p><strong>APPLIES TO:</strong> RackConnect v3.0, RackConnect v2.0</p>
<p>RackConnect is compatible with our dedicated Managed, dedicated Intensive, cloud Managed Operations, and cloud Managed Infrastructure service level offerings—giving you the ability to select the level of Fanatical Support® you need to properly manage your hybrid environment. Your dedicated and cloud support teams are your first points of contact for any RackConnect issues you may encounter.</p>
<p>Additionally, RackConnect leverages your existing cloud and dedicated service level agreements to provide you with support for your hybrid environment, and RackConnect does not include different service level agreements than what you already have in place.&nbsp; In some cases, you may have different levels of support between your dedicated and cloud environments.&nbsp; For example, you may have dedicated Intensive service level support for your dedicated devices, and Managed Infrastructure service level support for your cloud servers.&nbsp; This means that while your dedicated Intensive and cloud Managed Infrastructure support teams can help you isolate and resolve issues within your cloud and dedicated environments, they will not be authorized to login to your cloud servers to investigate issues.</p>
<p>As always, your service experience is our top priority, so to ensure the best possible level of support, we recommend that you utilize our dedicated Intensive and cloud Managed Operations service levels for your RackConnect hybrid solution. These service levels provide you with higher levels of support for your hybrid environment.</p>
