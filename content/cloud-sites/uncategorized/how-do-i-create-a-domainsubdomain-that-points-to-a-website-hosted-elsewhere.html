<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong>.</p>

<p>Follow these directions to point a domain or subdomain to a website that is <em>not </em>hosted on Cloud Sites.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com" rel="nofollow" title="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>Create the new domain or subdomain under the correct account. If you have any questions about how to do this, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/1132">Getting Started With Cloud Sites: How To Add A New Website</a>.</li>
	<li>After the domain or subdomain is set up in your account, add a PHP redirect to the <strong>web/content</strong> folder by using FTP. For information about how to do this, including using FTP, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/580">Getting Started With Cloud Sites, FTP/SSHFS/FTP Clients</a>.</li>
	<li>Using a text editing program (like Notepad or Wordpad), create a file with the following PHP redirect on your computer. After <code>Location:</code>, enter the URL that you want to redirect the website to (for example, <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/</code>).
	<pre>
&lt;?
header("Location: URL");
exit;
?&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Using the example link, the full script would look as follows:</p>

	<pre>
&lt;?php
header("Location: http://www.yourdomain.com/");
?&gt;
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Save this file as <strong>index.php</strong>.</li>
	<li>Log in to your new subdomain's FTP server.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the <strong>/www.yourdomain.com/web/content</strong> directory.</li>
	<li>Upload the <strong>index.php</strong> into this folder.<br />
	The redirect should be fully functional.</li>
</ol>
