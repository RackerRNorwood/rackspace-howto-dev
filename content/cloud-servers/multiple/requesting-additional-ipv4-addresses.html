<p>Rackspace offers the ability to add IPv4 addresses to Cloud Servers for a fee. If you wish to obtain an additional IPv4 address for your server please open a ticket through the Support section of the Cloud Control Panel to get policy information and approval.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>Due to the global shortage of IPv4 address space, Rackspace currently only offers additional IPv4 addresses for the following purposes:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>SSL on Cloud Servers</li>
	<li>NAT (Network Address Translation) on a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/vrouter/">Brocade Vyatta vRouter</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>The rates for additional IP addresses vary by region. Discuss rates for your region with the Support team during your set up.</p>

<h3>Requesting additional IP addresses</h3>

<p>Once approved for an additional IP address you'll be asked to supply the following information:</p>

<h4>Cloud Servers</h4>

<p>F<span>or an additional IPv4 address on a Cloud server you will need to provide:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>The name of the server for which you would like to add the IP address.</li>
	<li>The SSL certificate. The certificate must have been signed by a valid Certificate Authority; self-signed certificates are not accepted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Brocade Vyatta vRouters</h4>

<p>For an additional IPv4 address on a Brocade Vyatta vRouter you will need to confirm that you intend to use the Additional IPv4 address for the purpose of NAT.</p>

<p>Please note that we cannot allocate more than 4 additional IPv4 addresses to a single Cloud Server or to a Brocade Vyatta vRouter. This gives each Cloud Server or the Brocade Vyatta vRouter a maximum capacity of five (5) IPv4 addresses including the originally assigned public IP address.</p>
