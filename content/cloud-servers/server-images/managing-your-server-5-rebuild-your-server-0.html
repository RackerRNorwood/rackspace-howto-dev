<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp; Rebuilding your server from an image is not an option currently available for OnMetal servers.</p><p>One advantage of rebuilding your server (versus creating a new server) is that you retain the same IP address, which saves you from having to update your DNS records and wait for DNS propagation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Rebuilding an image destroys all of the data on the server. Be sure to back up any data you wish to keep in a safe location prior to performing this task.</p><ol><li>From the Cloud Servers page, click the <strong>Actions</strong>&nbsp;menu next to the server name.</li><li>Choose<em> Rebuild from Image</em>.<p><img style="border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;" src="http://c765420.r20.cf2.rackcdn.com/6_RebuildButtonnew.png" alt="" /></p></li><li>Select a Rackspace image or one of your own previously saved images from the Saved tab, then click Rebuild Server.<p><img style="border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;" src="http://c765420.r20.cf2.rackcdn.com/7_RebuildFromnew.png" alt="" /></p></li><li>A pop-up screen appears with the new root password. Save this password as you won't be able to see it again once you dismiss the message.</li></ol><p>The server's status changes to Rebuilding. When the build is complete, the status changes back to Active.</p><p style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;">&nbsp;</p>
