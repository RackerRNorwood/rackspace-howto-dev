<p>In this article we discuss adding <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/pricing.html">Google Apps</a> MX records to a domain managed via the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<h3>DNS</h3>

<p>If you haven't already, be sure you verify your domain with Google Apps through their administrative interface.</p>

<p>Once Google has successfully verified the domain the next step will be to add Google’s MX records to the domain's information in the DNS section of the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>

<h3>MX</h3>

<p>Google Apps provides five MX records to be added to the domain DNS settings. &nbsp;You can find the latest MX record values on <a href="http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=174125">the Google Apps web site</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have the MX records in-hand you'll want to add the records in the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<p>If you need help finding the screen to add a record to a domain we have an article with more details for our <a href="/knowledge_center/article/creating-a-dns-records-for-cloud-servers-next-generation-control-panel">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>Once we're on the “Add DNS Record” screen we should be able to fill in the necessary information for each record. &nbsp;Let's have a look at the interface in the control panel:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="382" src="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/addrecord.png" title="" width="570" /></p>

<p>As in the example above, you'll need to select "MX Record" as the record type to create a Mail Exchanger record for inbound email. Start with the first record on Google's list, which at the time of this writing is ASPX.L.GOOGLE.COM, and assign the priority Google recommends for that record (the number listed before the domain name on Google's table of MX entries).</p>

<p>Don't include a period at the end of the mailserver domain when you enter it. &nbsp;The system will add that for you behind the scenes if it's required.</p>

<p>Once you're done entering the first MX record repeat the process for the other four MX records.</p>

<h3>Check and Test</h3>

<p>Now that the MX records have been stored within the DNS settings for your domain, the changes should propagate after the time specified in the TTL has passed. &nbsp;You can test your changes with a DNS checker or using a Terminal to run the <code>dig</code> command.</p>

<p>You can install and use dig by following the instructions <a href="/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-essentials-6-using-dig-for-dns-troubleshooting">in this article</a>. &nbsp;To use dig to just check the MX records for the domain you can run the command:</p>

<pre>
dig -t MX greprest.com</pre>

<p>The results should look something like:</p>

<pre>
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;greprest.com.INMX</pre>

<pre>
;; ANSWER SECTION:
greprest.com.300INMX5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
greprest.com.300INMX10 aspmx2.googlemail.com.
greprest.com.300INMX10 aspmx3.googlemail.com.
greprest.com.300INMX1 aspmx.l.google.com.
greprest.com.300INMX5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.</pre>

<p>Now that we can see the MX records have propagated correctly we can run an email test.</p>

<p>Send an email through the Google Apps webmail interface to an email address you can access on a different domain, then reply to it. &nbsp;If the email to your domain gets back to Google Apps you'll know the DNS changes worked.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Google Apps allows for email service using your own domain for free, which can be useful when deciding whether to host email with an email hosting provider or run your own email environment.</p>

<p>This process is relatively simple to follow and can take up to around 10 minutes to complete, making it an easy way to get email up and running when you’re in a hurry.</p>
