<p>Because of the unique hosting environment of Cloud Sites, an addition to the code used for the <strong>Allow only</strong> feature via SSL is required.</p>

<p>In Cloud Sites, the requesting IP address coming into a server is the IP address of our load balancing server instead of the visitor's IP address. This means that limiting access by IP address through <strong>.htaccess</strong> file becomes problematic. To solve this problem, we provide an environment variable called <strong>HTTP:X-Forwarded-For </strong>that includes the visitor's IP address.</p>

<p>In the .htaccess file that contains your rules, insert the following code.</p>

<h4>Allow only a certain IP address</h4>

<pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{HTTP:X-Forwarded-For}&nbsp;000\.000\.000\.000
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</pre>

<p>Replace <strong>000\.000\.000\.000</strong> with your IP address. This allows only your IP address to access your site, and is a great way to develop your site without restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Implementing this code might prevent images from loading on your site. To address this issue, you can add the following code do your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;FilesMatch "\.(gif|jpe?p|png)$"&gt;
order deny,allow
allow from env=allowclient
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;</pre>
