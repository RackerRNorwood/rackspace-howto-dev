<p>A Start of Authority (SOA) resource record indicates which DNS name server is the best source of information for the specified domain. Every domain must have an SOA record.</p><p>When you add a domain to DNS, the email address that you indicate is added to the SOA record for the domain. This publicly associates the email with the domain.</p><p><img src="http://5637f99e22e42b3a3b0a-e2386ae7b063b70b5535752a5fd32819.r21.cf5.rackcdn.com/NewDNSPopOver.png" alt="" /></p><p>For example, the email address associated with the <strong>rackspace.com</strong> domain is <strong>hostmaster@rackspace.com</strong>. You can see the SOA record for&nbsp; <strong>rackspace.com</strong> by running the following command:</p><pre>dig rackspace.com +nssearch</pre><p>The following information is returned:</p><pre>SOA ns.rackspace.com. hostmaster.rackspace.com. 1392389079 300 300 1814400 300 from server 69.20.95.4 in 12 ms.</pre><p>The SOA record includes the following details:</p><ul><li>The primary name server for the domain, ns.rackspace.com</li><li>The e-mail for the domain, hostmaster@rackspace.com.</li><li>Revision number that changes whenever you update your domain.</li><li>Refresh time, the number of seconds before the zone should be refreshed.</li><li>Retry time, the number of seconds before a failed refresh should be retried.</li><li>Expiration time, the time, in seconds, before the data is considered unreliable.</li><li>Minimum TTL, this default applies to all resource records in the zone</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
