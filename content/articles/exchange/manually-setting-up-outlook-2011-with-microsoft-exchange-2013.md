color to a solid green.\

 \
 *Note: The dot might take a minute or two to change from amber to
green. If the dot doesn't change, check the account settings and
password and ensure that you're using the correct EWS server address.*

8. Close all windows.

If you already have email on the server, your email will slowly begin
to populate your inbox. This can take some time depending on how much
data you have.
