Every Rackspace product is backed by an industry-leading service level
agreement (SLA). You can read these agreements at
[http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla).
If you experience a technical or other issue for which you want to
receive an SLA credit, follow the procedure in this article.

Prerequisites
-------------

To receive a credit, the SLA incident must meet the following criteria:

-   The SLA incident must have occurred within the last 30 days<br>
    <br>
-   For specific concerns not mentioned in the SLA, the issue must have
    occurred within the last 60 days<br>
    <br>
-   Account balances must be current<br>
    <br>
-   You must meet SLA requirements and obligations within the agreed
    upon Terms of Service

If you meet this criteria, then you can request an account credit.

Request an SLA credit
---------------------

Follow these steps to request your SLA credit:

Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).<br>
<br>

Create a support ticket and enter **Credit Request** in the subject
field.<br>
<br>

In the **Message** field, provide the following information:<br>
<br>

-   Services affected<br>
    <br>
-   Summary of the incident<br>
    <br>
-   Date and time that the issue began<br>
    <br>
-   Date and time that the issue ended<br>
    <br>
-   Any associated correspondence relevant to the issue for which you
    want to receive credit such as logs, another ticket number, emails,
    or chats<br>
    <br>
-   Add any other details relevant to credit consideration<br>
    <br>

Click **Submit Ticket**.

Allow 3-5 business days for Rackspace to receive and review your credit
request, and to update your support ticket.

Issues not addressed by the SLA
-------------------------------

If you experience technical issues not specifically address by your
product SLA, Rackspace will still review your case. You can submit a
ticket stating your case and why you believe you are owed a credit. Be
sure to state how long you were affected and how you believe Rackspace
failed you.

Rackspace will not issue a credit for cases in which the Rackspace Terms
of Service or Acceptable Use Policy are violated.

Contact the Rackspace Cloud support team at 1 800 961 4454 (US toll
free) if you have any problems not addressed in this article.
