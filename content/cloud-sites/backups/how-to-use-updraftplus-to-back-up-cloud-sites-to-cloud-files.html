<p>UpdraftPlus is a WordPress plugin that gives users the ability to automatically back up their sites to Cloud Files. UpdraftPlus saves the backup files as standard (non-proprietary) zip files and the database into an ordinary SQL (text) file. This method simplifies the recovery of files and makes the backup files available through standard tools. Simpler recovery means less site downtime or data loss in the event of a system issue or security incident.</p>
