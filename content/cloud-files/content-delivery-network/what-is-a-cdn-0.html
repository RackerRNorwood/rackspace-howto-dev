<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of computers that delivers content to users across the globe. By leveraging a network, the content provider can deliver information quicker to end users across the globe, while improving performance, and increasing scalability and efficiency. The place where the content is originally stored is the origin server, and endpoint servers where users across the globe access the content are called edge servers. The longer it takes for information to travel from an edge server to the user, the slower the load time of the content.</p>

<p>The speed of delivery is constrained by the slowest network in the chain of computers that deliver the content from origin to end user. CDNs place servers around the world and, depending on where the end user is located, serves them with the closest or most appropriate server. CDNs cut down on the amount of travel your content must make. This is shown in the following figures.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>CDNs focus on improving performance of web page delivery. CDNs like Akamai's support progressive downloads, which optimizes delivery of digital assets such as web page images. CDN nodes and servers are deployed in multiple locations around the globe over multiple internet backbones. These nodes cooperate with each other to satisfy data requests by end users, transparently moving content to optimize the delivery process. The larger the size and scale of their Edge Network deployments, the better the CDN.</p>

<p>They generally push the Edge Network closer to end users. The Edge Network is grown outward from the origins by purchasing co-location facilities, bandwidth, and servers. CDNs choose the best location for serving content while optimizing for performance. They may choose locations that are the fewest hops or fewest number of network seconds away from the requesting client. CDNs choose the least expensive locations while optimizing for cost. CDNs use various techniques such as web caching, server-load balancing, and request routing to achieve the optimization goals.</p>

<p>Because closer is better, web caches store popular content closer to the user. These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements, reduce server load, and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache.</p>

<p>Server-load balancing uses a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to share traffic among a number of servers or web caches. Here, the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address. Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch. This has the advantages of balancing load, increasing total capacity, improving scalability, and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks.</p>

<p>Request routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request. This may involve directing a client request to the service node that is closest to the client, or to the one with the most capacity. A variety of algorithms for Global Server Load Balancing (shown in diagram) are used to route the request. Choosing the closest service node is done using a variety of techniques including proactive probing and connection monitoring.</p>
