Rackspace Monitoring bills you by how much you use. While other
monitoring services lock you into a month-long or even year-long
contract, with Rackspace Monitoring you are billed by the hourly usage
based on how many checks were running in that hour, and from how many
monitoring zones were involved. Adjusting your usage is quick and easy,
and this flexibility can help reduce unnecessary costs. Never again will
you have to pay for more than you use.
