<h2 class="title"><a name="cookbook-download-4.1"></a>Cookbook Changes</h2>

<p>The following changes have been made to the Rackspace Private Cloud cookbooks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The latest cookbook version number is <code class="filename">v4.1.1</code>. This change is reflected in the instructions under <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#install-cookbooks" target="_top">Install the Rackspace Private Cloud Cookbooks</a>.</li>
	<li>The override attributes for defining nova-network have changed. This change is reflected in the instructions under <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#define-override-attrs" target="_top">Define Network Attributes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title"><a name="HA-VIPs-4.1"></a>Changes in HA VIP Attributes</h2>

<p>A new configuration block must be used in <code class="filename">override_attributes</code> to define the virtual router ID and network for the VIPs. Refer to <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-openstack-with-rackspace-private-cloud-tools#nova-cluster-ha" target="_top">Controller Node High Availability</a> for detailed information about this configuration.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading your environment from an older configuration in which VIP vrid and networks were not defined, you may have to remove the keepalived configurations in <code class="filename">/etc/keepalived/conf.d/*</code> and run chef-client before adding the VIP vrid and network definitions to override_attributes.</p>

<h2><a name="rabbitmq-4.1.1"></a>RabbitMQ Clustering</h2>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.1.1 builds out clustered RabbitMQ by default. Fresh installations with v 4.1.1 include this feature automatically, but installations created with Rackspace Private Cloud v 4.0.0 cookbooks will have to be upgraded with the procedure documented in <a class="link" href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/upgrading-your-private-cloud#upgrade-rabbitmq-v41" target="_top">Upgrading Your Private Cloud</a>.</p>
