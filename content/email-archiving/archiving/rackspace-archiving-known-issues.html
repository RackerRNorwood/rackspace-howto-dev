<p>There are several known issues that you might encounter when using Rackspace Email Archiving. This article describes these issue.</p>

<h2>Email forwarding</h2>

<p>If you set up a rule on a mailbox to automatically forward messages without saving a copy, that mailbox does <em>not</em> archive the messages that are forwarded and deleted using the rule. Messages are archived in the final destination mailbox only. If the final destination address is outside of your domain, messages are not archived at all.</p>

<p><strong>Aliases</strong></p>

<p>If you have an alias set up to forward email to an address outside of your domain, that email is not archived. When you send as an alias, Rackspace only archives<a> </a>the sent message if you are sending from a domain with archiving enabled or one of its<a> </a>accepted domains or domain aliases.&nbsp;If a recipient is archived, the inbound message is always archived for that recipient..</p>

<p><strong>Distribution lists</strong></p>

<p>When an email is sent from a Rackspace Email address to a Microsoft Exchange distribution list, the archive does not include the individual email addresses of the recipients on the distribution list.</p>

<p>Example: If you send an email from your Rackspace Email account to the ABC distribution list that exists in Microsoft Exchange, the archive will only reflect that an email was sent to the list without recording the individual recipientsâ€™ names in the <strong>To</strong> field.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Group lists</strong></p>

<p>If an email is sent to a group list that contains recipients on another domain, and the outside domain has archiving, the <strong>To</strong>&nbsp;field of that archived message might reveal the email addresses of all list members.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

<p>If archiving is enabled for the domain but an address at that domain has a rule or filter to delete messages from specific senders, the deleted messages are <em>not</em> archived.</p>
