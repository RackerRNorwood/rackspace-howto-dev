<p>POP email is typically stored locally on a computer and removed from the mail server after being downloaded by the client. &nbsp;In many cases, this data cannot be migrated with our migration tool when it does not exist on your source mail server. &nbsp;The steps in this article will walk you through performing a manual migration of POP data via Outlook to a Rackspace Email account via IMAP.</p><p>We'll accomplish this task by adding your new Rackspace Email IMAP account to the same profile that your POP account is on. This change will allow you to easily move all of the locally stored email to your new Rackspace Email account.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about the differences between POP and IMAP, please see the help topic,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-email-imap-vs-pop">IMAP vs. POP</a>.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>Before performing the steps below, make sure that mailboxes have already been created on the Rackspace environment and that the MX records have been updated so that email is routing correctly to Rackspace.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-rackspace-email-mailboxes">How to create mailboxes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/updating-your-mx-records-microsoft-exchange">How to change MX records</a></li></ul><h3>Changing Settings</h3><p>For increased security, we recommend that you use our secure (SSL) servers, as detailed below.
