<p>Rackspace has recently changed the names of the flavors that you can choose when creating cloud servers. The goal of this change is to simplify flavor selection by aligning the flavor names with the intended workloads. The old flavor names are officially deprecated but will still be recognized in API commands for a time. The new names are the only flavor names visible in the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<p>The following table maps the old flavor names to the new ones.&nbsp;</p>

<table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Previous flavor<br />
			class name</th>
			<th scope="col">Current virtual<br />
			flavor class name</th>
			<th scope="col">OnMetal flavor<br />
			class name</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Standard</td>
			<td>Standard</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Performance 1</td>
			<td>General Pupose</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Performance 2</td>
			<td>I/O Optimized</td>
			<td>OnMetal I/O</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Compute Optimized</td>
			<td>OnMetal Compute</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Memory Optimized</td>
			<td>OnMetal Memory</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The new flavor names also reflect new functional differences. We now offer servers that are optimized for memory, compute, and I/O. Additionally, the General Purpose servers (which were previously Performance 1) can have&nbsp;a larger system&nbsp;disk instead of using&nbsp;split system and data&nbsp;disks.</p>

<p>The different types of servers are part of the expected growth life cycle of using cloud servers. That life cycle goes from general purpose virtual servers to workload-optimized virtual servers to workload-optimized OnMetal servers. For more information about this cloud server life cycle, see the graphic on the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Cloud Servers</a> product page.</p>
