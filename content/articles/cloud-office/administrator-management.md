From the Administrators section of the control panel, you can manage
your administrators' access and activity.

You can add multiple administrators with varying degrees of account
access. There are Super, Standard, and Limited administrators. Limited
administrators only have access to specifically assigned sections of the
control panel. You can also monitor and export logs of all administrator
logins and actions.

The following articles provide instructions for managing your
administrators:.
