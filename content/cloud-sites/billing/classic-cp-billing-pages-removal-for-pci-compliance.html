<p>&nbsp;The Billing section of your existing control panel will be transitioned into our new unified control panel. This is a first step towards incorporating Cloud Sites into the unified control panel.</p><p>1. <strong>Why have my billing pages disappeared from the Cloud control panel?</strong></p><p>Through this change, the Cloud Control Panel’s access to credit cards has been consolidated, and the billing pages have been moved to the ‘Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel’.</p><p>2. <strong>How do I access my billing pages?</strong></p><p>Click on the Billing link present under your account in the 'Cloud Control Panel' (<a style="line-height: 1.538em; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/">https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/</a>)<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;and you will be taken to the billing pages present in the ‘Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel' (</span><a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">https://mycloud.rackspace.com/</a>)&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">where you will be able to perform all the billing related activities. The Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel&nbsp;will open up in a new window or tab without closing your current window.</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><img class="image-full_width" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/field/image/billingflow.png" alt="" width="700" height="389" border="2" /></p><p>3. <strong>How do I get back to the original Cloud Control Panel after I am done with viewing the Billing pages?</strong></p><p>Once you close the current '<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel'</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;window, you should have the ‘Cloud Control Panel’ window open in your browser.</span></p><p>Thank you for your continual feedback to improve our offering.
