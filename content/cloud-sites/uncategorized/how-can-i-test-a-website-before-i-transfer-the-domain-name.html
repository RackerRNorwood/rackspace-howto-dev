<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong>.</p>

<p>The Cloud Sites Control Panel provides a URL that you can use to test your website before you change the DNS of your domain. Access the URL as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the left navigation pane of the Cloud Sites Control Panel, click <strong>Hosting &gt; Cloud Sites</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click the name of the site that you want to test.</li>
</ol>

<p>The test URL is located on the <strong>General Settings</strong> tab, under <strong>Viewing and Editing</strong>. The link is your full domain name followed by the cluster of the default technology that you chose when you added the site, such as <strong>.php5-1</strong> or <strong>.asp1-1</strong>, followed by <strong>websitetestlink.com</strong>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>http://www.domain.com.php5-1.websitetestlink.com</li>
	<li>http://www.domain.com.asp1-1.websitetestlink.com</li>
</ul>

<p>The test links are generated according to the cluster and default technology on which your domain resides, so your specific test URL might be different from the examples.</p>

<p>For information about how to add content to your test website by using the test FTP, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/580"> Getting Started With Cloud Sites, FTP/SSHFS/FTP Clients</a>.</p>
