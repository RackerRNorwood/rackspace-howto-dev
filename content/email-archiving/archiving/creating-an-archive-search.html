<p>After your email data has been received and indexed, you can perform archive searches. Nightly collections index the email and add it to the archive. You can also run collections manually through the Archive Manager. This article describes the steps for creating an archive search in Cloud Office.</p>

		<li><strong>Advanced</strong>—Search by sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachment with greater fine-tuning control. For more information, see <a href="#advancedSearch">Advanced Search</a> after these steps.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Enter a name&nbsp;for the search.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enter any terms you wish to search for under<b> Search Terms</b>, as appropriate.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you wish to send alerts whenever a search is conducted, click <strong>Enable Search Alerting on this search</strong>. You can select which users receive the alert by their permission level (ie. if you select, "Search User" any user with Admin User access will receive an alert).<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You now can chose any optional parameters for the search.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><em>Dates</em> allows you to select when dates you want the search to include</li>
		<li><em>Tags</em> assist in categorizing searches.Tags can be predefined under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab. To access predefined tags, click <strong>Tags</strong> on the <strong>New Search</strong> page.</li>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a id="advancedSearch" name="advancedSearch"></a>Advanced search</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes your search results can be too large to sort through, and in cases when you are looking for something specific, it is often best to use the <strong>Advanced Search</strong> option. The more specific information you give the search, the better and more accurate your results will be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enter as much available search information as possible in the fields under <strong>Search Options</strong>.</p>
