<p>A CNAME record is way to link your Cloud Files container to a branded URL that you display instead of a CDN URL. For example, you might want create a CNAME record that links your CDN URL (for example, <code>http://c186397.r00.cf1.rackcdn.com</code>) to a shorter or branded URL (for example, <code>http://images.mycompany.com</code>).</p>

<h2>Find your CDN URL</h2>

<p>Before you can create the CNAME record, you need to know the CDN URL of the container. You can find this in the Cloud Files section of the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the gear icon next to the container name and selecting <strong>View All Links</strong>. A popup dialog box with the CDN links to the container is displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="" border="2" height="246" src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/1080-2_2.png" width="492" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can request your container information via the Cloud Files API.</p>

<h2>Set up CNAME records</h2>

<p>You set up your CNAME record by managing your DNS. Within your DNS settings, request a new record. Ensure that your CNAME record points to your container's CDN URL and not your object's CDN URL.</p>

<p>If you are using Rackspace Cloud DNS, creating a CNAME record that uses the example values introduced at the beginning of this article would look as follows:</p>

<p>If you want to edit or delete your CNAME record, you can also do that by managing your DNS in your existing tool.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You are not charged extra for using CNAMEs.</li>
	<li>At this time, CNAMEs do not work with SSL (or HTTPS) delivery.</li>
</ul>
