<p><strong>APPLIES TO</strong>: RackConnect v3.0, RackConnect v2.0</p>
<p>We have created this article to cover many of the <em>key terms</em> you will encounter with RackConnect—to help you better understand how RackConnect works. Next to each term, in parenthesis, we have noted whether the term applies to RackConnect v2.0 (v2.0), RackConnect v3.0 (v3.0), or both (v2.0, v3.0).</p>
<h4>Access Lists (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>Used on network devices to control what network traffic is allowed between network segments. Access lists are also known as ACLs.</p>
<h4>Automation Features (v2.0)</h4>
<p>Automation features control which actions the RackConnect automation systems will and will not take against your environment.&nbsp;In certain cases, the settings may differ between your cloud account and your individual cloud servers.&nbsp;The cloud account settings will be used for all new servers you build in the future, while the existing cloud server settings will be used if you perform a rebuild or make other changes to your cloud server.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not currently possible for you to adjust automation features settings; they are displayed for informational purposes only.&nbsp; Please contact your support team if you need to modify these settings.</p>
<h4>Cloud Networks (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>Isolated networks that you can create and attach to your cloud servers, as network interfaces, that only allow traffic between cloud servers that are part of the same isolated network. In essence, they are secure networks whose traffic is restricted to only the cloud servers that you allow. In the case of RackConnect v3.0, they are also used to communicate with your dedicated networks.</p>
<h4>Connected Network Device Role (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>The dedicated network device that provides a physical connection and path to the cloud-side of your RackConnect environment.&nbsp; This device can be a firewall or a load balancer. RackConnect gateway IP addresses live on this device. Additionally, a single network device can function in both the edge and connected network device roles.</p>
<h4>Edge Network Device Role (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>The outermost dedicated network device in your RackConnect configuration—it is the device that directly connects to the Internet. This is typically a firewall, but it can also be a load balancer in certain deployment scenarios. Additionally, a single network device can function in both the edge and connected network device roles</p>
<p>Network Policies (v2.0):Define network access allowed in one of five RackConnect traffic scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic from Cloud Servers to Dedicated</li>
<li>Traffic from Cloud Servers to the Internet</li>
<li>Traffic from Cloud Servers to Cloud Servers (for example, traffic between a web tier and an application tier, both hosted on Cloud Servers)</li>
<li>Traffic from Dedicated to Cloud Servers</li>
<li>Traffic from the Internet to Cloud Servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Network policies provide you with the ability to match network traffic based on certain criteria—(hosts, networks, and cloud server name matches)—in order to limit access to only allowed protocols and ports (or port ranges).</p>
<h4>Network Policy Templates (v2.0)</h4>
<p>Provide an easy way of getting started with RackConnect network policies; they allow you select from among some of the most common RackConnect network policy options. For example, the “Basic Access Configuration Template,” if applied, allows you to have unrestricted network access between your dedicated and cloud servers.</p>
<h4>PublicNet (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>A network that may be added to your cloud servers, as a network interface, to allow traffic directly with the public Internet. If enabled, it is very important to secure this network, as this network is vulnerable to attacks from the Internet.</p>
<h4>QoS (v3.0)</h4>
<p>Stands for quality of service. With RackConnect v3.0, it is used to limit the amount of bandwidth allowed between your cloud and dedicated networks via RackConnect.</p>
<h4>RackConnect Configuration (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>Represents a single deployment of a RackConnect solution.&nbsp; A configuration is comprised of dedicated network devices that function in the RackConnect edge and connected network device roles, along with the stored settings needed to make these devices function with RackConnect. You may have multiple RackConnect configurations. A configuration is normally associated with one or more cloud accounts.</p>
<h4>ServiceNet (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>Cloud ServiceNet is a shared network within each region that may be added to your cloud servers, as a network interface. It is normally utilized to allow cloud servers to take advantage of other Public Cloud products, such as Cloud Files, to communicate between your cloud servers in a given region, or in the case of RackConnect v2.0, to communicate with your dedicated network. If enabled, it is very important to secure this network, as other Rackspace Public Cloud customers are also on this network.</p>
<h4>Edge Network Device Role (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>The outermost dedicated network device in your RackConnect configuration—it is the device that directly connects to the Internet. This is typically a firewall, but it can also be a load balancer in certain deployment scenarios. Additionally, a single network device can function in both the edge and connected network device roles</p>
<h4>Connected Network Device Role (v2.0, v3.0)</h4>
<p>The dedicated network device that provides a physical connection and path to the cloud-side of your RackConnect environment.&nbsp; This device can be a firewall or a load balancer. RackConnect gateway IP addresses live on this device. Additionally, a single network device can function in both the edge and connected network device roles.</p>
