<p>Caching rules are designed to determine how long your content should live on the edge nodes before the origin is checked for an update. If your content changes frequently, you might want to set up a time to live (TTL) rule that pulls content from the origin every few minutes. If your content does not change frequently, we suggest you set a longer TTL of 12-24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you create multiple rules, you must order rules from least specific to most specific.</p>

<p>For more information about rules, see the following sections and <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cdn-edge-rules">Rackspace CDN edge rules</a>.</p>

<p>After you create your service, you enter caching rules in the <strong>Caching Rules</strong> section of the CDN service page.</p>
