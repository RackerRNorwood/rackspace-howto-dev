This article describes how to set up your new Android phone with your
Exchange 2010 email account.

**Note:** The administrator of your account must add ActiveSync to your
email through their Administrative Control Panel.

1.  Tap the **Settings** icon, and then tap **Accounts and Sync**.

4.  On the next page, enter the rest of the necessary information and
    then tap **Next**:

    -   **Email address**: Enter your email address (for
        example,**test@emailcomany.org**).
    -   **Server address**: Enter **connect.emailsrvr.com**.
    -   **Domain**: Leave this field blank.
    -   **Username**: Enter your email address again.\
         Some devices might have the settings as domain\\username. On
        those devices, the field should have a backslash (**\\**) before
        your email address (for example, **\\test@emailcompany.org**).
    -   **Password**: Enter your password.
    -   Select **This server requires an encrypted SSL connection**.

5.  If you are prompted to enable remote security administration, tap
    **Ok** or **Allow**.\
     This allows you to remotely perform a factory reset (delete all
    data) on the device from Outlook Web App if the phone is lost or
    stolen and there is sensitive company information on the device.
6.  Select the services that you want to synchronize with the Exchange
    server and when to synchronize. Then, tap **Next**.

    setup**.
