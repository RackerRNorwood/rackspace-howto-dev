This article describes how to configure an Exchange 2013 account on your
Apple iOS device.  The administrator of your account must verify that an
ActiveSync license is attached in your account via the Cloud Control
Panel.  If any Internet connectivity issues prevent you from
successfully setting up Exchange, contact your wireless provider or
ISP.\
