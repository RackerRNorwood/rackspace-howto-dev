<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-WhatistheInter-regionconnectivityservice?"><a id="Q1" name="Q1"></a>What is RackConnect RegionLink?</h4>

<p>RackConnect RegionLink&nbsp;is a Limited Availability service that enables Dedicated Hosting customers to connect infrastructure that they have deployed across two&nbsp;or more Rackspace data centers. The service uses multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) virtual private network (VPN) across Rackspace Backbone and enables connectivity between resources at Layer 2 or Layer 3.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Whydocustomersneedit?"><a id="Q2" name="Q2"></a>Why do you need it?</h4>

<p>Some Dedicated Hosting&nbsp;customers cannot tolerate the risk of unexpected downtime. To mitigate the risk of an outage caused by a problem with a single Rackspace region, customers might want to distribute their compute resources across multiple Rackspace regions. Interregional connectivity is a way to transfer data between Rackspace regions at lower&nbsp;latency&nbsp;and with better throughput&nbsp;than over the Internet.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Whataretheusecases?"><a id="Q3" name="Q3"></a>What are some common use cases for this service?</h4>

<p>Customers might want to establish a backup or high availability duplicate of an existing configuration (for example, database replication) or geographically distribute applications closer to their customers to minimize latency and improve network performance.</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-WhatarethebenefitsoftheInter-regionsolution?"><a id="Q4" name="Q4"></a>What are the benefits of the interregional solution?</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Bypasses multiple layers of network devices, which improves latency</li>
	<li>Better option than using upgraded firewalls just for VPN throughput</li>
	<li>Built-in redundancy</li>
	<li>Fully managed and supported by Rackspace</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Whatkindofcustomersisitfor?"><a id="Q5" name="Q5"></a>Which Rackspace customers can use this service?</h4>

<p>The RackConnect RegionLink service&nbsp;is available only for Dedicated Hosting customers at this time.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-WhichDatacentersisthisserviceavailablein?"><a id="Q6" name="Q6"></a>In which data centers is this service available?</h4>

<h4>The service is curently available in all three US data centers (IAD, DFW, and ORD).&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-IsaDedicatedAggregationdeviceneededtousethisservice?"><a id="Q8" name="Q8"></a>Is a dedicated aggregation (customer edge) device needed to use this service?</h4>

<p>Yes, a dedicated aggregation, or customer edge (CE) device is needed at this time.<br />
We recommend one of the following devices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cisco 4948E</li>
	<li>Arista 7050</li>
	<li class="O1">Cisco Nexus 3064</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Isthetrafficsecure?"><a id="Q9" name="Q9"></a>Is the traffic encrypted?</h4>

<p>The service does not provide any encryption. It is purely an MPLS VPN connection (L2/L3). The traffic rides across the Rackspace backbone all the way through without hitting the Internet.</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Whatkindofspeedsaresupported?"><a id="Q10" name="Q10"></a>What kind of speeds are supported?</h4>

<p>At launch, the service supports connectivity speeds of 100 Mbps, 500 Mbps, and 1 Gbps. Faster speeds will be supported on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Isthereredundancybuiltintothesolution?"><a id="Q11" name="Q11"></a>Is redundancy built in to the solution?</h4>

<p>Yes, there are two connectivity options into the backbone from the dedicated aggregation (customer edge) device. Both options use two&nbsp;uplinks to the data center provider edge (PE) device.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-WhatistheSLAforthisservice?"><a id="Q12" name="Q12"></a>What is the SLA for this service?</h4>

<p>The SLA varies based on which of the above redundancy option the customer chooses. If the customer wants only one Dedicated Aggr. device, the SLA will be limited to a 1 hour hardware replacement time for the Aggr. device. If the customer uses&nbsp;two CE devices we have an SLA of 99.9 % connection availability between data center edge devices. See <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/rackconnect_regionlink">Rackspace RackConnect RegionLink Service Level Guaranty</a> for the SLA.</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-ForanMPLSL3VPNconnection,howmanyVPNprefixescanbeexchangedbetweenthesites?"><a id="Q13" name="Q13"></a>For an MPLS L3 VPN connection, how many VPN prefixes can be exchanged between the sites?</h4>

<p>Up to 100 prefixes can be exchanged.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-IsIPv6trafficsupported?"><a id="Q14" name="Q14"></a>Is IPv6 traffic supported?</h4>

<p>No. Only IPv4 is supported at this time.</p>

<h4 id="Inter-regionconnectivityFAQ-Iwanttoseeasummaryofwhatwearelaunching"><a id="Q15" name="Q15"></a>How do I order the service, and what is the pricing?</h4>

<p>Contact your Rackspace account representative for ordering and pricing information.</p>
