When you are done using your server and are ready to delete it, you can
do this through the Cloud Control Panel.  If you have already saved a
backup image of your server, you can use that image to create a new
server at a future time.  That server will be an exact clone of your
current server at the time the backup image was saved, but it will have
a different IP address.

**Note**: We recommend using Cloud Backup and Cloud Images before you
delete your cloud server instance to provide options for recovering your
server and its configuration at a later date.

To delete the server, click the gear icon next to in in the Cloud
Control Panel and select **Delete Server**.

You are asked for confirmation before the server and its data are
deleted forever. 

All together, these administration tips and tools give you total control
over your server, and provide some good troubleshooting resources.  The
next article describes how to build and configure a Cloud Load Balancer
for directing traffic to multiple servers in a high availability
solution.  For detailed instructions, see [Configuring a Load
Balancer. ](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/configuring-a-load-balancer)
