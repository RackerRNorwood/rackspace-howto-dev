<h3 id="how-am-i-billed-for-rackspace-services">How am I billed for Rackspace services?</h3>

<p>Many of our services follow a utility pricing model and are billed for hourly usage each month on the anniversary date of the account creation. &nbsp;Charges on invoices are based on service usage since the last invoice date. &nbsp;The only exception is Cloud Sites, which is invoiced in advance of usage per a monthly subscription price.&nbsp; More details about our product pricing are located on our <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public-pricing/">Cloud Pricing Page</a>.</p>

<p>Payments are charged automatically to a credit card.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-pay-in-advance">Can I pay in advance?</h3>

<p>You can prepay a commitment pricing contract for your&nbsp;account if you meet the minimum requirements for our Commitment Pricing Program. &nbsp;Any usage beyond the minimum commitment amount will be invoiced at the utility rate on your monthly date of you account’s anniversary.&nbsp; If your account was created on the 25th of the month, you will be billed monthly on the 25th. You can find more information about the Commitment Pricing Program on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/discounts/">Cloud Servers Discount page</a>.</p>

<h2>Charges</h2>

<h3 id="cs-separate-charges">What are the separate&nbsp;charges and minimums that are applied to Cloud Servers pricing?</h3>

<p>The listed prices for Cloud Servers include both&nbsp;<em>raw infrastructure</em>&nbsp;and <em>managed service</em> charges. The price&nbsp;is split to show what you are paying for when you partner with us.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The raw infrastructure price&nbsp;can be contrasted with&nbsp;what other hosting companies charge for a cloud server. &nbsp;It covers&nbsp;the infrastructure of&nbsp;the hosted server.</li>
	<li>The managed service price applies to the <em><strong>Fanatical Support</strong></em>® that we offer on top of our infrastructure. This&nbsp;<em>Service Level Rate</em> varies based on the service level that you choose for your cloud account.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service Level Rate <em>minimums </em>are based on the service level that choose for your cloud account. The minimums represent&nbsp;the minimum monthly charge for the service. &nbsp;If the cost of the resources you use in a month total more than the minimum, the Service Level Rate minimum does not apply. If your costs for a month are less than the minimum, the difference between your usage costs and the Service Level Rate minimum are added to your bill.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="why-am-i-still-being-billed-i-never-used-the-services.">Why am I being billed for a service when I'm not using it?</h3>

<p>Billing begins the moment that you provision a service or server on your account. You are charged&nbsp;for servers and services as long as their resources&nbsp;remain allocated to&nbsp;your account, even if they are&nbsp;not in use or are disabled. When you delete the server or service&nbsp;from your account, its resources are freed up for someone else to use and you are longer billed for them.</p>

<p>You can delete cloud servers and services using the <a href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.&nbsp; To cancel a Cloud Sites service or Rackspace support for Azure, create a ticket for our billing team.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#top">back to top</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="i-am-still-getting-billed.-how-do-i-delete-or-cancel-my-services">How do I delete or cancel my services?</h3>

<p>Log in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>&nbsp;and review all services to ensure that all your data is backed up outside of Rackspace’s environment. You can then submit a cancellation request by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Account: <em>yourUserName</em></strong> in the upper-right corner of the page.</li>
	<li>From the menu, select <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the Account Settings page, click <strong>Cancel My Account</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cancellations cannot be initiated over the phone. The cancellation submission is your authorized approval for Rackspace to delete and cancel your services in their entirety. Rackspace is not liable for data loss if you do not have a copy of your data outside of our Cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Note that the Cloud Sites service can be canceled only after all sites are deleted manually from the account.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your account open without receiving future charges, you can manually delete all services from your account profile.&nbsp; This method enables you to use the Rackspace services&nbsp;in the future without the need to register a new account.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-agree-with-my-bill.-how-can-i-get-a-credit">I don’t agree with my bill. &nbsp;How can I dispute a charge?</h3>

<p>You can create a ticket via the&nbsp;<a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/">Cloud Control Panel</a>&nbsp;with the details of your dispute for one of our Account Managers to review.&nbsp; A credit is granted only if there is an error related to our billing system or a service error according to your service level agreement (SLA).</p>
