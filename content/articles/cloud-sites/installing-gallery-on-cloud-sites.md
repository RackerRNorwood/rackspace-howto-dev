------------------

1.  The information needed here is provided when you created your
    Database, if did you not already write them down, you can view this
    by logging into your Cloud Sites Control Panel and select your
    domain from the list. Click on the features tab and select the
    database from the list. After you click it, you will see all the
    info you need, except for the password. This is only known to you.
2.  Fill in the DB Hostname: with the hostname you now have. DB
    Username: with the database username you created, Fill in DB
    Password: with the password you created, Fill in DB Name: with the
    database name you created as well. Once you have filled in those
    fields, click Continue to Step 6.
3.  The admin account username and password for Gallery will be auto
    generated. Make sure to write this down because you will need it. 
4.  Click Start Using Gallery.

Success
-------

You have now successfully installed Gallery. Please keep in mind that
this is a very much used and known PHP application, just like any well
used software it is susceptible to exploit. The best way to protect
yourself and your data is to update your software regularly, I recommend
joining their mailing list, this will keep you up to date on releases
and security problems, so you can react accordingly.
