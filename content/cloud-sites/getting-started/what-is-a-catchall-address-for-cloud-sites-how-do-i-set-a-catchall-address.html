<h5 class="p1"><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">NOTE:&nbsp;<em>This documentation refers to a feature that is no longer available for Cloud Sites. &nbsp;This article is here for the purpose of legacy support only.</em></span></h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A catchall address is a designated mailbox where any email sent to a non-existent email address will be delivered. To better help explain catchalls, review the example below:</p><p>You have the following mailboxes setup on your account:</p><ul><li>john@yourdomain.com</li><li>bill@yourdomain.com</li><li>catchall@yourdomain.com (<strong>Which is set as the catch-all</strong>)</li></ul><p>Now in this example, any email sent to john@yourdomain.com would be delivered to that corresponding mailbox.</p><p>The same would hold true for any email sent to bill@yourdomain.com. However, what would happen if an email was sent to "frank@yourdomain.com"?</p><p>Because the mailbox frank@yourdomain.com has not been setup in the system, normally the email would be rejected with a "user unknown" message and would be returned to the sender. However, if you have a catchall setup, like in the example above, the email would be delivered to the catch-all mailbox. This would hold true for email sent to any other addresses which have not been setup as mailboxes on the system.</p><p>To set up a catchall email account for a particular domain:</p><ol><li>Log in to your <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com" title="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com" class="external text" rel="nofollow">control panel.</a></li><li>Select the "<strong>Hosting</strong>" link in the left navigation bar. Then select "<strong>Cloud Sites</strong>"</li><li>Select the domain for which you wish to add a catch-all account from the "Websites" list.</li><li>Click the "<strong>Email Accounts</strong>" tab in the bar at the top of the page.</li><li>Add the email account that you want to use for the catch-all (i.e. catchall@yourdomain.com).</li><li>Under "<strong>Mail Preferences</strong>" at the bottom of the page, select "Send them to this account (catchall)" and select the account you want to use from the pull-down menu.</li></ol>
