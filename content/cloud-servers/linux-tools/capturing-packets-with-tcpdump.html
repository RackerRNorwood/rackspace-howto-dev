<p>Tcpdump is a powerful network debugging tool that can be used for intercepting and displaying packets on a network interface. An important feature of tcpdump is a filter that allows you to display only the packets you want to see.</p><h3>Installation</h3><p>In this example we are using Ubuntu 8.10; however, the installation steps are similar for other Linux distributions. The following command will install tcpdump under Ubuntu:</p><pre>sudo apt-get install tcpdump</pre><h3>Usage</h3><pre>sudo tcpdump [options] [filter expression]</pre><p>By default, tcpdump will capture packets on eth0. We can specify a different interface using the '-i' command line flag. This command will capture all packets on the eth1 interface:</p><pre>sudo tcpdump -i eth1</pre><p>In the following example we will listen to all UDP connections:</p><pre>sudo tcpdump udp</pre><p>Use this command to capture packets for a specific port:</p><pre>sudo tcpdump port 80</pre><p>Our command is returning all packets which have port 80 as their destination or source port.</p><p>Now let’s be more specific and capture only packets with destination port 80. If you have a web server on your cloud, then you can use the command below to see incoming packets.</p><pre>sudo tcpdump dst port 80</pre><p>You can also capture packets for a specific host. This command will catch packets coming only from IP 1.2.3.4:</p><pre>sudo tcpdump src host 1.2.3.4</pre><p>Tcpdump can take logical arguments such as ‘and,’ as well as ‘or.’ You can use logical statements in a tcpdump command. For example, to catch all the SSH packets going from an SSH server to a client with IP 1.2.3.4:</p><pre>sudo  tcpdump "src port 22" and "dst host 1.2.3.4"</pre><p>Raw packets can be conveniently saved to a file using the '-w' option:</p><pre>tcpdump host 1.2.3.4 -w /home/users/demo/demo.dump</pre><p>Let's read the saved file:</p><pre>tcpdump -r /home/users/demo/demo.dump</pre><h3>Summary</h3><p>Tcpdump is a powerful packet sniffer and a common tool used by system administrators to solve network problems and investigate traffic. It can be used with Boolean expressions to capture only those packets you're interested.</p>
