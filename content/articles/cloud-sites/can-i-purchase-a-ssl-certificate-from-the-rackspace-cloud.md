<span>Unfortunately, we do not provide the actual SSL certificates.
Please see our article on which SSL certificates we support, you will
need to purchase your cert from a supported vendor. </span>

Click
[here](/howto/supported-ssl-certificates-on-cloud-sites)for
a list of supported SSL certificates. There is a fee associated with
providing the SSL capability and this can be found on the Cloud Sites
pricing page [here](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/pricing/).
