***Note:** We no longer accept new sign-ups for Cloud Drive, though it
is still supported for existing customers. New customers should use the
[equivalent service offered via JungleDisk](https://jungledisk.com/)
instead.*

### Prerequisites

Drive](https://admin.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/creating-online-disks-for-cloud-drive)

Cloud Drive allows administrators to create Sub-Accounts for users
within your group for sharing. After you've created your master account,
you'll be prompted to create Sub-Accounts for users. Let's take a look
at the article below to get you setup:

### Setting Up Sub-Accounts:

1. First thing you'll do is login to your control panel at
[http://cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com). Select **Manage via
Jungle Disk**, and then select **Sub-Account Management** under
Workgroup.

*Note: If you're not allowed to create a Sub-Account, be sure that
you've created your Master Account first.*

2. Next, create a Username, Password, and Tags (optional) for your
Sub-Account.

*Note: Tags are used to sort users in generated reports and are purely
for informational purposes (e.g., Finance, CEO, HR).* 

3. Select the following option you would like to apply to your
Sub-Account.

*Note:* *If the Private Online Disk check box is selected, an online
disk will be created for this user and they will automatically be
granted access to this disk.* 

4. If you're adding a Private Online Disk for this sub-account, select
the following options that you would like applied:

-   Storage Provider - Select a storage company. This will be the data
    host for the online disk.

-   Location - Select the location for your data storage.

-   Enabled Features - Select disk features as desired.

-   Local Drive Mapping - The user can map the disk on their computer
    just like a network drive.

-   Sync Folders - The user can select files and folders to
    automatically sync between the online disk and their computer.

-   Automatic Backup - The user can schedule backups for selected
    folders or drives and restore data from the online disk.
