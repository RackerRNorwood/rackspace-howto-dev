<h3 id="what-is-rackspace-intelligence">What is Rackspace Intelligence?</h3>

<p>Rackspace Intelligence delivers an intuitive interface that gives you a transparent view into the health of your infrastructure, along with actionable insights to improve system performance and availability. It provides a universal dashboard that enables you to obtain information about any monitoring tools and entities regardless of your underlying infrastructure. You can use it to configure monitoring on your entities, such as servers and databases, and view their monitoring status. It also provides visualizations that give you a view of the trends in your resource use.</p>
