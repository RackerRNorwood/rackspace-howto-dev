<p>A Container is a “storage compartment” for your data and provides a way for you to organize that data. You can think of a Container as analogous to a folder in Windows® or a directory in UNIX®. The primary difference between a Container and these other “file system” constructs is that Containers cannot be nested. You can have up to 500,000 Containers in your account, but they only exist at the “top level” of your account and Containers cannot reside within other Containers.</p><p><img style="width: 390px; height: 109px;" src="http://c15156697.r97.cf2.rackcdn.com/1.png" alt="" /></p><p>Note:&nbsp; Containers scale to about one million objects before peformance degrades. Containers can only be removed from Cloud Files if they do NOT contain any storage Objects. In other words, make sure the Container is empty before attempting to delete it.</p>
