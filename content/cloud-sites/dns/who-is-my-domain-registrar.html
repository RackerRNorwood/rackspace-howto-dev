<p>The company who serves as your domain registrar is responsible for managing your domain registration records. Your domain registrar is often the company who sold you your domain name. Register.com, GoDaddy, and TuCows are examples of popular domain registrars. Typically, you'll contact your registrar (or log in to their website) in order to renew your domain name, change your name servers, or update your contact information. If you purchased your domain name through us, we serve as your domain registrar. We also serve as your domain registrar if you elected to transfer your domain name to us. If don't know where you bought your domain name or who serves as your registrar, you can find out by doing a WHOIS search. For more information, please see the article <a href="/knowledge_center/index.php/How_do_I_do_a_WHOIS_search">How do I do a WHOIS search?</a></p>
