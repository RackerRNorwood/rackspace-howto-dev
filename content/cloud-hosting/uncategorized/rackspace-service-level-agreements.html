<! ---- Request an SLA credit ---- />

<p>Every Rackspace product is backed by an industry-leading service level agreement (SLA). You can read these agreements at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla">http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla</a>. If you experience a technical or other issue for which you want to receive an SLA credit, follow the procedure in this article.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To receive a credit, the SLA incident must meet the following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The SLA incident must have occurred within the last 30 days<br /><br /></li>
    <li>For specific concerns not mentioned in the SLA, the issue must have occurred within the last 60 days<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Account balances must be current<br /><br /></li>
    <li>You must meet SLA requirements and obligations within the agreed upon Terms of Service</li>
  </ul>

<p>If you meet this criteria, then you can request an account credit.</p>

<h2> Request an SLA credit</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to request your SLA credit:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log in to the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com">Cloud Control Panel</a>.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Create a support ticket and enter <strong>Credit Request</strong> in the subject field.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>In the <strong>Message</strong> field, provide the following information:<br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Services affected<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Summary of the incident<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Date and time that the issue began<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Date and time that the issue ended<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Any associated correspondence relevant to the issue for which you want to receive credit such as logs, another ticket number, emails, or chats<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Add any other details relevant to credit consideration<br /><br /></li>
      </ul>
    <li>Click <strong>Submit Ticket</strong>.</ul>

<p>Allow 3-5 business days for Rackspace to receive and review your credit request, and to update your support ticket.</p>

<h2>Issues not addressed by the SLA</h2>

<p>If you experience technical issues not specifically address by your product SLA, Rackspace will still review your case. You can submit a ticket stating your case and why you believe you are owed a credit. Be sure to state how long you were affected and how you believe Rackspace failed you.</p>

<p><Note:</strong> Rackspace will not issue a credit for cases in which the Rackspace Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy are violated.</p>
