<p>POP email is typically stored locally on a computer and removed from the mail server after being downloaded by the client. &nbsp;In many cases, this data cannot be migrated with our migration tool when it does not exist on your source mail server. &nbsp;The steps in this article will walk you through performing a manual migration of POP data in Outlook 2011 for Mac to a Rackspace Email account via IMAP.</p><p>We'll accomplish this task by adding your new Rackspace Email IMAP account to the same profile that your POP account is on. This change will allow you to easily move all of the locally stored email to your new Rackspace Email account.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about the differences between POP and IMAP, please see the help topic,&nbsp;<a href="/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-email-imap-vs-pop">IMAP vs. POP</a>.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>Before performing the steps below, make sure that mailboxes have already been created on the Rackspace environment and that the MX records have been updated so to that email is routing correctly to Rackspace.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/adding-rackspace-email-mailboxes">How to create mailboxes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/updating-your-mx-records-microsoft-exchange">How to change mx records</a></li></ul><h3>Export Outlook Data</h3><p>Before you can import your data into Rackspace Email you'll need to export it to a file from Outlook 2011.</p><ol><li><p>Go to the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;menu and select&nbsp;<strong>Export.</strong>&nbsp;A new window will appear.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Outlook for Mac Data File (.olm)</strong>&nbsp;for the file type.</p></li><li><p>Select the items you’d like to export.</p></li><li><p>Press the&nbsp;<strong>purple arrow</strong>&nbsp;in the bottom-right-hand corner of the window to move to the next page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Note: Only mail data will sync from Outlook 2011 to Rackspace Email. &nbsp;All other items will continue to be stored locally.</em></p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Export_Shot_Mac.png" alt="" width="405" height="356" /></p></li><li><p>Choose whether you'd like to delete the items from your local client after export.&nbsp;Press the <strong>purple arrow</strong>&nbsp;to continue.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Delete.png" alt="" width="405" height="354" /></p></li><li><p>A new window will appear asking where you’d like to save the file. &nbsp;Choose a location that is easy to remember such as the <strong>Desktop</strong>.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Location_file%20copy.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="325" /></p></li></ol><p>The items will now be exported. &nbsp;You will see a progress bar on your screen letting you know how much of the process has completed.</p><h3>Import into Rackspace Email</h3><p>When you import your mail into Rackspace Email, you can choose to either leave your old mailbox configured in Outlook 2011 or remove it. In this example, we will remove the mailbox and setup the Rackspace Email mailbox by itself via IMAP.</p><p>To setup your Rackspace Email mailbox as IMAP see the following guide: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-rackspace-email-with-outlook-2011">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/setting-up-rackspace-email-with-outlook-2011">How to setup Rackspace Email via IMAP in Outlook 2011</a>.</p><p>For increased security, we recommend that you use our secure (SSL) servers. If your internal system configurations require non-SSL ports, those settings are available in the article referenced previously, <a href="/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-email-imap-vs-pop">IMAP vs. POP</a>.</p><p>When your Rackspace Email account is set up in Outlook, you can import the .olm into the new mailbox.</p><ol><li><p>Click <strong>File&nbsp;</strong>&gt; <strong>Import</strong>&nbsp;to import the .olm file. &nbsp;A pop-up window should appear.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Outlook Data File (.pst or .olm)</strong> and then click on the <strong>purple arrow</strong> on the bottom-right-hand corner of the window to continue.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Import.png" alt="" width="394" height="348" /></p></li><li><p>On the next page select <strong>Outlook for Mac Data File (.olm)</strong> and then click on the <strong>purple arrow</strong>.</p></li><li><p>In the new window that appears, select the location of the .olm file and then click on the <strong>Import</strong>&nbsp;button. &nbsp;You will see a progress bar while the data is imported.</p><p><img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Import_2%20copy.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="344" /></p></li><li><p>Move items from the .olm to the newly configured Rackspace Email mailbox.</p></li></ol><p>When the process completes you will see a new section in the left-hand sidebar of Outlook 2011 titled <strong>On My Computer. &nbsp;</strong>In this section you will be able to see the mail you exported from your previous account.&nbsp;You can either drag and drop individual items into your new mailbox or drag and drop the entire Inbox folder. &nbsp;<em>Note: You may want to create a new folder in your Rackspace Email account to help keep track of the items you have imported.</em></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/2013-11-25_1013%20copy_0.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="660" /></p><p>Once the items are moved into the Rackspace Email account in Outlook 2011, it will start to sync with Webmail and any other device connected as IMAP to this mailbox.</p>
