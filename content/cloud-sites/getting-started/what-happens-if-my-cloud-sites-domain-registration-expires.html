<p>For any domain that is registered with or transferred to The Rackspace Cloud, we will automatically notify you as the expiration date for your domain name nears. The notices will be sent to the email address listed under the administrative contact for that particular domain name.</p><p>A total of three email notices will be sent to you, beginning 90 days before your domain is set to expire, and a fourth notice will be sent out 10 days after the expiration date. If you do not renew before the stated expiration date, the domain name will be held in reserve for a redemption period of 45 days. During this redemption period, you may incur a registry-imposed redemption fee in order to reactivate your domain. To renew or redeem your domain name, please contact <a href="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do" title="http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do" class="external text" rel="nofollow">customer support</a>.</p>
