<h2>Terminal Services In A Hosted Exchange Environment</h2><p>Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services) provides a method for having multiple users access Outlook from one centrally managed server, the users connect to the server to access Outlook and view their mailboxes. Terminal Services is a great tool and we get a lot of questions on it so we wanted to take some time to discuss why it is not a good fit for our Hosted Exchange environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Email and Apps clients who have used Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services) with our services have had very poor experiences in the past. &nbsp;From this we have learned the advanced technical issues associated with users connecting to our environment from a server are not something we can reasonably, effectively, or Fanatically resolve. &nbsp;We need to ensure we are a good fit for the client, setting both the client and ourselves up for success; for this reason Rackspace does not support it.</p><p><strong>What about Outlook 2010 running in Cached Exchange Mode via Terminal Services?</strong></p><p>Outlook 2010 is able to run in Cached Exchange Mode when connected via Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services) and will connect to our Exchange environment. &nbsp;However, we have had clients in the past who had poor experiences with our Hosted Exchange when connecting via Terminal Services. &nbsp;It is the many potential complications associated with users connecting via Terminal Server which makes it a poor fit for our environment and therefore something Email and Apps does not support or encourage.</p><p>If you still feel that Terminal Services may be a good fit for your set up, we would recommend looking at <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft's TechNet</a> site for further information including the following <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff394406.aspx">article</a>.</p>
