<p><strong>Note:</strong> The information contained in this article is for Cloud Office account administrators only.</p>

<p>The Archive Manager&nbsp;records all user interactions. To view a report of activity, Account Administrators can create an audit report. Reports can include information about the following items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collections (when email is indexed and made searchable)</li>
	<li>User management</li>
	<li>Account settings</li>
	<li>Creation of searches</li>
	<li>Changes in scope to existing searches</li>
	<li>Viewing of searches by users</li>
	<li>Comments and ads placed on messages</li>
	<li>Exporting of emails from a search</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reports are sent to the email address associated with your archiving account admin user name.</p>

<p>To create an archive audit report, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f">Archive Manager</a>.&nbsp;<br />
	For more information, see <a href="http://rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/log-in-to-the-archive-manager">Log in to the Archive Manager</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the upper-right corner of the window, click <strong>Admin</strong> to access the Admin dashboard.<br />
	<strong>Note</strong><span>: There are three dashboards for top-level administrators:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>, <strong>Admin</strong>,&nbsp;and <strong>Admin User</strong>. If you do not see the&nbsp;</span><strong>Admin</strong><span>&nbsp;link in the upper-right, you are already on the Admin dashboard.</span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Reports</strong> tab.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Choose report</strong>&nbsp;dropdown&nbsp;menu, select one of the following report types:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Activity by User</strong>—This report lists all users, their actions, the date of the actions, and the number of times that the actions were performed.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity by UI Action</strong>—This report lists all actions in alphabetical order, the users that performed the actions, the date, and the number of times that the actions were performed.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity by Date</strong>—This report lists by date the users who performed actions, the action performed, and the number of times that the actions were performed.</li>
		<li><strong>Collection by Mailbox</strong>—A collection indexes gathered email data and makes it searchable. This occurs automatically nightly. This report lists mailboxes, the number of email messages collected, the data size, and the date collected. These mailboxes are not your user mailboxes; they are collection points, and there is usually just one per account.</li>
		<li><strong>Collection by Date</strong>—A collection indexes gathered email data and makes it searchable. This occurs automatically nightly. This report lists the dates of collections, the number of email messages collected, the data size, and the mailbox collection point.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For&nbsp;<strong>Format option</strong>, select whether you want the report in <strong>PDF</strong> or <strong>CSV</strong> format.&nbsp;The PDF format is ideal for read-only reports. The CSV format is ideal if you want to sort or repurpose the report data.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For&nbsp;<strong>Date Range</strong>, specify a date range for the report. To select a specific date range, click the calendar icons.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Sort options</strong> section, indicate how you want the data to be sorted in the <strong>Order by&nbsp;</strong>dropdown menu. You can sort data by user name (<em>User</em>), date created (<em>Date</em>), or by user actions (<em>Activity</em>).<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For <strong>Sort order, </strong>choose you want your report in&nbsp;ascending or descending order.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Create Report</strong>.&nbsp;The report is sent to the email address associated with your account admin user name.</li>
</ol>
