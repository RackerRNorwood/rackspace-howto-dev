If you are unsure what the name is, visit&nbsp;https://www.sslshopper.com/certificate-decoder.html and enter the certificate. The information is displayed as shown in the following example:</p>

<p class="Syntax">If you encounter&nbsp;any errors&nbsp;during installation, contact a member of our Support team to help complete the installation.</p>
