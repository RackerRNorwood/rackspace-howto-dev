<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article refers to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>. You can access this interface from the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Control Panel</a> by clicking the <strong>Cloud Control Panel</strong> menu at the top of the window and selecting <strong>Cloud Sites</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p>When you configure some Pre Hypertext Processor (PHP) web applications, you might need to provide the absolute path, full path, or web root for your website. If your web application uses PHP or your default site technology is Linux, you'll typically want to use the Linux web directory. If you don't know whether you need the Linux or Windows path, consult a web developer or the web application vendor, or contact support for a recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need to find your website's Windows path, see <a href="/knowledge_center/node/619">Locate the Windows path for your Cloud Sites website</a>.</p>

<h2>To find the websiteâ€™s Linux path</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to the <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com">Cloud Sites Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left navigation pane, click <strong>Hosting &gt; Cloud Sites</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click on the name of the website for which you need to obtain the Linux path.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Features</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page to the <strong>Server-side Paths</strong> section.<br />
	Under <strong>Linux Info</strong>, the absolute path to your Linux PHP site is the one labeled <strong>Web directory</strong>. The path should resemble the following format: <strong>/mnt/stor1-wc1-dfw1/123456/www.domain.com/web/content/</strong></li>
</ol>
