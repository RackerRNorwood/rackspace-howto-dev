<p><strong>Applies to:</strong>&nbsp;RackConnect v3.0</p>

<p>The following table describes&nbsp;the limitations of RackConnect v3.0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="1">
	<tbody>

				<li>Cloud Networks limitations also apply to cloud networks that are associated with&nbsp;RackConnect v3.0. For example, Cloud Networks is currently limited to 10 isolated networks and up to 250 cloud servers per network;&nbsp;these limitations also apply to cloud networks that are associated with RackConnect v3.0. For a list of current Cloud Networks limitations, see&nbsp;the articles&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/create-an-isolated-cloud-network">Create an Isolated Cloud Network</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-networks-faq">Cloud Networks FAQ</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Currently, only cloud servers configured with a single cloud network are supported.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Avoid using network ranges for your cloud networks that overlap with the Rackspace public cloud ServiceNet IP address ranges of 10.176.0.0/12 and 10.208.0.0/12. Also avoid using network ranges that are already in use on the dedicated-side of your network or that consist of public IP adresses. Other than the preceding caveats we&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;that you use network ranges from within the standard private IPv4 address spaces of 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255, or 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255 for your cloud networks. We also recommend that you select a /24 CIDR subnet mask to simplify management, because&nbsp;a /24 CIDR is large enough to support 250 cloud servers&nbsp;(the cloud servers limit per network). If you are planning&nbsp;to build and delete a large number of cloud servers every hour, then you might&nbsp;want to use a subnet that allows for a larger number of cloud servers, such as a /23 CIDR, to avoid potential issues with cloud network IP address availability.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>You cannot have a single network subnet that spans both your cloud and dedicated environments. To clarify, your dedicated-side's network subnets&nbsp;on your dedicated side must be on a different subnet than your cloud network's subnet.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers are automatically assigned their cloud network subnet's first IP address as the default gateway. The gateway IP address lives on the RackConnect v3.0 connected network device, and is manually configured by Rackspace during the RackConnect v3.0 implementation process.</li>

				<li>Not all of the Rackspace public cloud products are compatible with RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers. To verify which offerings are supported, see&nbsp;the article, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackconnect-v30-compatibility-matrix" target="_blank">RackConnect v3.0 Compatibility Matrix</a>.</li>
				<li>QoS: Traffic that traverses across your RackConnect v3.0 link between your cloud and dedicated environments is now bandwidth limited by Quality of Service (QoS) policies. By default, these QoS policies are set to limit bandwidth throughput to 100 Mbps (megabits per second), but with Rackspace approval, they may be increased. If you have need for more than 100 Mbps of bandwidth, please <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/support" target="_blank">contact us</a> for details on potential one-off solutions.</li>
				<li>As with RackConnect v2.0, RackConnect v3.0 bandwidth might&nbsp;be limited by the capabilities of the Cloud Servers flavors that you are running, your network device's capabilities, and your dedicated server's capabilities.</li>
				<li>The default setting for RackConnect v3.0 access between cloud and dedicated network segments is to restrict all communication. During the RackConnect v3.0 implementation process and afterwards, you&nbsp;can provide us with details on how you want the access between your network segments configured. Alternatively, you can&nbsp;also setup any necessary firewall rules on your own by using the Firewall Manager feature available in the <a href="https://my.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">MyRackspace Portal</a>.</li>
				<li>Your devices must be deployed in a region supported by RackConnect v3.0. The&nbsp;regions supported, as of October 2014, are DFW, IAD, ORD, LON, HKG, and SYD.</li>
