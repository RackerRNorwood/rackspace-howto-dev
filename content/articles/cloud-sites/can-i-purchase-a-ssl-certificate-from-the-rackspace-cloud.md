Unfortunately, we do not provide the actual SSL certificates. Please see
our article on which SSL certificates we support, you will need to
purchase your cert from a supported vendor. 

Click
[here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/supported-ssl-certificates-on-cloud-sites)for
a list of supported SSL certificates. There is a fee associated with
providing the SSL capability and this can be found on the Cloud Sites
pricing page [here](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/pricing/).
