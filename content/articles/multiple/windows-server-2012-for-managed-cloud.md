Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Licensing
---------------------------------------

Windows Server 2012 has a simplified licensing model and single
codebase. All options are available regardless of which license model
you select, although the Datacenter edition is required for the
unlimited virtualization use rights. Customers who would have had to
chose among Web, Standard and Enterprise editions can now simply select
Standard edition.

*Note: Cloud customers will have access to Windows Server 2012 images
through the next generation Cloud Servers API and Control Panel.*

*Note: MyRack is used by customers with dedicated servers and is the
interface for RackConnect.*
